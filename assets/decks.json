    "description": "<p>Just like everyone else, I started learning to play A:NR with Jinteki Vs. Kate (as the rulebook suggests). I played too many games as corp only with a single runner friend (playing Kate of course) and I always felt so poor. Not many ways to make <span class=\"icon icon-credit\"></span>credits other than <span class=\"icon icon-click\"></span>clicking for it or <a href=\"/en/card/01110\">Hedge Fund</a> if I'm lucky enough, while on the other side there was a juicy <a href=\"en/card/01044\">Magnum Opus</a> for up to 8cr per turn. Frustrated as I was, I started researching for my first deckbuilding. Rules were simple enough regarding Agendas and Influence, but I still couldn't make my core <a href=\"en/card/01067\">Jinteki</a> deck rich enough. How can I protect myself if I can't pay 4<span class=\"icon icon-credit\"></span> for a <a href=\"/en/card/01070\">Snare!</a> or advance a <a href=\"/en/card/01069\">Project Junebug</a>? I figured Jinteki mindgames are not for beginners and went exploring other factions. The glacier approach seems like the safest most reliable route, build an ICE fort and advance. <a href=\"/en/card/01054\">HB</a>] became my favorite, followed by <a href=\"/en/card/01093\">Weyland</a>. <a href=\"/en/card/01080\">NBN</a> feels very awkward, no traps for shell game, no money for big forts...lots of tags and little punishment....my mind couldn't even comprehend why would anybody play that ID out of the box.</p>\n\n<p>It's the poorest corp with some of the best cards that can't even use because of low funds. Not enough ETR (end the run) ice and the runner roams free wherever he pleases. Then I noticed the best agenda in the whole game: <a href=\"/en/card/01081\">AstroScript Pilot Program</a>, it's a 3/2 with the best ability, better than <a href=\"/en/card/01068\">Nisei MK II</a> in my opinion. This faction is made for fast advance and there must be a way to make it work.</p>\n\n<p>I splashed some extra economy (2x <a href=\"/en/card/01098\">Beanstalk Royalties</a>, 3x <a href=\"/en/card/01056\">Adonis Campaign</a> and some cheap to rez ice like <a href=\"/en/card/01103\">Ice Wall</a>. As the game progresses, <a href=\"/en/card/01103\">Ice Wall</a> can grow more powerful with the help of <a href=\"/en/card/01089\">Matrix Analyzer</a>.</p>\n\n<p>NBN's shenanigans will begin mid game:\n- Score an <a href=\"/en/card/01081\">Astro</a> out of hand using <a href=\"/en/card/01059\">Biotic Labor</a>.\n- Score an <a href=\"/en/card/01081\">Astro</a> out of hand using <a href=\"/en/card/01092\">SanSan City Grid</a>\n- Score an agenda out of hand using <a href=\"/en/card/01092\">SanSan City Grid</a> &amp; <a href=\"/en/card/01081\">Astro</a> tokens.\n- Let the runner swim in tags with the help of <a href=\"/en/card/01088\">Data Raven</a>, <a href=\"/en/card/01112\">Hunter</a> and <a href=\"/en/card/01089\">Matrix Analyzer</a>, and score an agenda from hand with <a href=\"/en/card/01085\">Psychographics</a>.\n- Score <a href=\"/en/card/01082\">Breaking News</a> on a <a href=\"/en/card/01092\">SanSan City Grid</a> and last click <a href=\"/en/card/01084\">Close their Accounts</a>. Or just simply score it from hand.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/en/card/01083\">Anonymous Tip</a> will help rush the pieces early.</p>\n\n<p>A few pieces I left behind and why:</p>\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"/en/card/01087\">Ghost Branch</a> - waste of adv. <span class=\"icon icon-credit\"></span></li>\n<li>1x <a href=\"/en/card/01088\">Data Raven</a> - expensive to rez, 2x are plenty in the deck.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/en/card/01086\">SEA Source</a> - useless card unless you urgently need the runner tagged for <a href=\"/en/card/01099\">Scorched Earth</a> - waste of <span class=\"icon icon-credit\"></span></li>\n<li>1x <a href=\"/en/card/01082\">Breaking News</a> - Lower agenda density</li>\n</ul><p>Should you want the extra <a href=\"/en/card/01082\">BN</a>, consider a couple of <a href=\"/en/card/01101\">Archers</a> to effectively lock the runner out of a server.</p>\n\n<p>Most ice is cheap to rez, use the expensive <a href=\"/en/card/01090\">Tollbooth</a> for locking R&amp;D and the scoring remote. Put something in front of it against Criminals because of <a href=\"/en/card/01021\">Inside Job</a>.</p>\n",

I wanted to try building decks for all of the factions over the course of the event to get a feel for the card pool.</p>\n\n<p>Nothing too fancy here: use good criminal events to do good criminal stuff. <a href=\"/en/card/20027\">Aurora</a> and <a href=\"/en/card/20030\">Peacock</a> are prohibitively bad, but I probably should have had a backup <a href=\"/en/card/20030\">Peacock</a>. The hope is that you can use <a href=\"/en/card/20029\">Femme Fatale</a> if you have to deal with Tollbooth. MU was a little snug (due to <a href=\"/en/card/20048\">Battering Ram</a> and the desire to have multiple <a href=\"/en/card/20028\">Faerie</a>/<a href=\"/en/card/20029\">Femme Fatale</a> on the board), so I've got a couple of <a href=\"/en/card/20057\">Dyson Mem Chip</a> to support.</p>\n\n<p>I was pretty happy with this deck overall. It won during the tournament (match is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dNvyw-W6Bk\">here</a> ), and felt like the mix of draw and econ kept my tempo nice and steady, and <a href=\"/en/card/20024\">Special Order</a> kept me feeling comfortable with my ability to handle whatever showed up.</p>\n\n<p>Probably would be worth making room for a <a href=\"/en/card/20034\">Crash Space</a> to counter Punitive Counterstrike.</p>\n",

Bad, and <a href=\"/en/card/02006\">Peacock</a> is not much better. Whatever savings they get from their 2<span class=\"icon icon-credit\"></span> +3 strength, they immediately lose because it costs 2<span class=\"icon icon-credit\"></span> to break a subroutine. And what if you only need one extra strength? <em>What if you come accross a piece of ice with more than 1 subroutine?</em></p>\n\n<p>Well bugger to that I say, <a href=\"/en/card/01051\">Crypsis</a>, you're in. At least the Criminal killers are pretty darn good. <a href=\"/en/card/02104\">Faerie</a> loves low strength, high subroutine breakers, but she'll be as efficient as you can get against pretty much anything. And <a href=\"/en/card/01026\">Femme Fatale</a>, how I love you. No more worries about Tollbooth, Flare... Just a happy day to be a criminal.</p>\n\n<p>The problem with <a href=\"/en/card/01051\">Crypsis</a> is that his favourite food is my favourite furniture: Piles of money. Therefore we're going to have to get a job. A <a href=\"/en/card/01029\">Bank Job</a>. Failing that, we can find an <a href=\"/en/card/01019\">Easy Mark</a>, or maybe get our hands dirty with a <a href=\"/en/card/02022\">Liberated Account</a>. If worst comes to worst, an honest <a href=\"/en/card/01053\">Armitage Codebusting</a>. Of course, our good friend Gabe gets 2<span class=\"icon icon-credit\"></span> forhis first successful run against a HQ, and with <a href=\"/en/card/01008\">Datasucker</a> and <a href=\"/en/card/01015\">Ice Carver</a>, we shouldn't have too much trouble getting into what we want.</p>\n\n<p><em>Made with one Revised Core Set</em></p>\n",

This is a good start, I'm only missing 1 to make it 49 cards and the minimum for this ID is 45 cards. Let's get to it step-by-step:</p>\n\n<p>[1] Agenda Density. The deck at 49 cards requires 20-21 agenda points. It is always best to go max cards at the minimum points to reduce the likelihood of drawing agendas. I have a total of (11) agenda cards at 20 points.</p>\n\n<p>[2] Decent Spread of ICE. Generally about 15-18 cards in total. Since the ID is about traces, those with traces are auto-includes to maximize ID's advantage. I have a total of (6) Sentries, (5) Barriers and (5) Code Gates.</p>\n\n<p>[3] Economic Engine. Generally 9-12 cards in total. In fact, I have 8 in total I have to make up on this later.  </p>\n\n<p>[4] Use Influence. This ID comes with up to 15 to spend. Use influence to import tricks to confuse and surprise the Runner or to shore up weaknesses in the deck. Here's my thought process for this faction teaching deck.<br />\n- added cards that help in advancement tokens, <a href=\"/en/card/01103\">Ice Wall</a>, <a href=\"/en/card/01100\">Shipment from Kaguya</a> and <a href=\"/en/card/02033\">Trick of Light</a>.<br />\n- added <a href=\"/en/card/01070\">Snare!</a> and <a href=\"/en/card/01104\">Shadow</a> since I am playing tags and ID has trace advantage.   </p>\n\n<p>[5] Cutting Cards. We have far more than needed to reach 49 cards in total.<br />\n- removed <a href=\"/en/card/01083\">Anonymous Tip</a> we have high agenda density don't want to draw too many out.<br />\n- removed <a href=\"/en/card/01111\">Enigma</a> because there is excess Code Gate ICEs.<br />\n- removed <a href=\"/en/card/01113\">Wall of Static</a> preferring Ice Wall.    </p>\n\n<p>Every card should be readily understood, and there should be a minimum of rules clarifications necessary.

    "description": "<p>I put this deck together for a tournament where we were restricted to only use cards from ONE core set plus ONE cycle or deluxe box of our choice. So I went with HAP for some funny Jinteki shenanigans and I like criminal in general.</p>\n\n<p>The tournament was 4 rounds of swiss, 9 players, I got a bye in the first round.\nAfter that I went 2-2 (runner wins), 2-2 (corp wins, both flatlines), 4-0 (Jinteki flatline). It was a really fun tournament and a great format to attract newer players since you don't need all cards. </p>\n\n<p>This is a kill deck basically, where I intend to land a brain damage or two with Tori Hanzo and Cerebral Cast to make it easier to get the kill. The best ways to get Hanzo to trigger is a House of Knives token, Data Mine or Komainu since these deal a single net damage, Troubleshooter is there to help Komainu. Note, I hadn't played a single game with my decks so I had no idea what to expect and it was really difficult to anticipate what other players would bring.</p>\n\n<p>This deck lost the first game to Gabe when he found 2 Future Perfect in HQ, and won both psi games on the first tries, after a pretty horrible mulligan. I managed to slow him down a bit at least with a successful Psychic Field and Cerebral Cast.</p>\n\n<p>Game 2 was also vs a Gabe, he ran into a Data Raven pretty early and decided to go tag me. I found a Scorched and two EMP pretty fast and got the kill.</p>\n\n<p>Game 3 I played vs Noise. I scored a House of Knives early, put down a Hanzo on R&amp;D and snuck in a nice brain damage. Together with another brain damage from Cerebral Cast things looked good. but he managed to steal 3 agendas for 5 points. I put down a Philotic, Snare and House of Knives naked and hoped he wouldn't find the Philotic. He decided to install a Medium and go for R&amp;D instead. He saw a Tori Hanzo on the first run, his third click, and trashed it with his last 2c. His last click he found some ICE or something on the top which he Imp:ed away and a Future Perfect underneath. At first he was celebrating thinking that he won, but then remembered that he was broke so I won the psi game. On my turn I scored the Philotic for 3+1 net damage, enough to flatline with his brain damage!</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>I'm building some decks with only the Core Set plus all three deluxe expansions to see what types of archetypes are will be available permanently throughout Netrunner's lifecycle. I'll put <a href=\"/en/decklists/find?title=Big+Boxes+Only\">\"big boxes only\"</a> in the deck titles so they can all be retrieved via search.</p>\n\n<hr /><p>An attempt to build Dan D'Argenio's Reg-Ass MaxX with access to only the big boxes. While <a href=\"/en/card/01001\">Noise</a> might be the strongest Anarch in a world without Jackson Howard, this is about as solid a middle-of-the-road Anarch deck we could build with no frills but a strong breaker suite and good support cards.</p>\n\n<h3>Economy</h3>\n\n<p>MaxX builds typically rely on either <a href=\"/en/card/01018\">Account Siphon</a> or <a href=\"/en/card/02091\">Kati Jones</a> for their economy. If we want to build a \"good stuff\" deck with <a href=\"/en/card/03038\">Clone Chip</a>s, we can't afford Siphon, and Kati isn't in a big box. That makes our economy here a little shaky; <a href=\"/en/card/07036\">Day Job</a> is great recovery but inflexible &amp; <a href=\"/en/card/01053\">Armitage Codebusting</a> is fine but not particularly efficient. At the very least, this deck has the ability to rebound from low money very easily, but it likely will not be rich.</p>\n\n<p>I also considered <a href=\"/en/card/05050\">Tri-maf Contact</a> as a poor person's <a href=\"/en/card/02091\">Kati Jones</a> but ultimately decided against it. <a href=\"/en/card/01005\">Cyberfeeder</a> is another oft-forgotten economy source Anarchs will always have access to, &amp; with this many viruses it works well.</p>\n\n<h3>Card Choices</h3>\n\n<p>While Lotus Field isn't in a big box, it's still wise to choose breakers for every eventuality. <a href=\"/en/card/01026\">Femme Fatale</a> is a great silver bullet &amp; <a href=\"/en/card/01043\">Gordian Blade</a> gives us an efficient, pumpable decoder.</p>\n\n<p>Viruses are what makes Anarch strong &amp; we have <em>all</em> the good core set ones here. Given the card pool we're using, this is probably the best possible deck for burning down ICE in real-time with <a href=\"/en/card/03038\">Clone Chip</a> &amp; <a href=\"/en/card/01012\">Parasite</a>. While the breaker suite is a strength, the deck can get pretty far with a handful of <a href=\"/en/card/01008\">Datasucker</a> tokens &amp; access to <a href=\"/en/card/01012\">Parasite</a>.</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>Original deck notes:</p>\n\n<p>This is the Reina deck that I played in the first Stimhack 3-Core (S3C) tournament. I wanted to try building decks for all of the factions over the course of the event to get a feel for the card pool.</p>\n\n<p>On the runner side, I thought that Anarch was in decent shape with <a href=\"/en/card/20016\">Liberated Account</a>, <a href=\"/en/card/20003\">Retrieval Run</a> and (critically) a 1-link runner that can use <a href=\"/en/card/20057\">Dyson Mem Chip</a> to turn on <a href=\"/en/card/20060\">Underworld Contact</a> for (as far as I know), the only drip econ on the runner side in the core set.</p>\n\n<p>No particular tricks here-- <a href=\"/en/card/20022\">Forged Activation Orders</a> was intended to work with the ID ability to extend early game economic pressure and potentially trash hard-to-deal-with ICE such as Hadrian's wall and Archer before they become a problem. The rest is basically breakers, econ, and breaker support.</p>\n\n<p>This deck lost (and lost badly) to a Weyland Punitive + DRT kill deck. I was extremely short of draw-- I knew this would be an issue with just the 2 <a href=\"/en/card/20038\">Diesel</a>, but the only other draw in core is <a href=\"/en/card/20036\">Mr. Li</a> and I found the tempo hit from installing him to be unpalatable. </p>\n\n<p>I think that <a href=\"/en/card/20057\">Dyson Mem Chip</a> with <a href=\"/en/card/20060\">Underworld Contact</a> is a good base for Reina's econ in this format, and the hope was that I could set that up for drip so that I could spend clicks to draw and come out ahead. In my game, I didn't get this up until turn 11, by which point I was well behind on board state. </p>\n\n<p>Looking back on it, I think that dropping <a href=\"/en/card/01020\">Forged Activation Orders</a> and <a href=\"/en/card/20039\">Indexing</a> for some mix of <a href=\"/en/card/20038\">Diesel</a>, <a href=\"/en/card/20026\">HQ Interface</a>, <a href=\"/en/card/20043\">The Maker's Eye</a>, and <a href=\"/en/card/20036\">Mr. Li</a> would be helpful.</p>\n\n<p>My game <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWiHzrYDPIQ\">is recorded here</a>, but I was having audio problems intermittently so it is kind of hard to follow :/</p>\n",

Why not gain 2<span class=\"icon icon-credit\"></span> on a successful HQ run? Or tax the corp more for their ice? Well, as usual, that was just me being an idiot. You see, she has more than just +1<span class=\"icon icon-mu\"></span>. She has a (minimum) deck size of 40.</p>\n\n<p>What does all this mean? Well, two things. One, you get a badass rig, and two, you're more likely to get said rig. And oh my, what a rig we'll be building.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/en/card/01044\">Magnum Opus</a> is just silly. 2<span class=\"icon icon-credit\"></span>/<span class=\"icon icon-click\"></span> looks amazing, doesn't it? Believe me. It's <em>better.</em> <a href=\"/en/card/01043\">Gordian Blade</a> is just an amazing decoder. Clean. Efficient. Sure to keep those sysops scratching their heads. I love it. <a href=\"/en/card/01042\">Battering Ram</a> isn't ideal, but don't feel sheepish about using it. We have the <span class=\"icon icon-mu\"></span>, we can afford to spend some. It's decent, and it'll bust some heads. <a href=\"/en/card/01046\">Pipeline</a> is bad and won't be appearing here. Instead, we'll be dancing with <a href=\"/en/card/01026\">Femme Fatale</a>, charming our way past anything that stands in our way. All this sits at an impressive 6<span class=\"icon icon-mu\"></span>. Thankfully we get 4 standard, 1 from our favourite W\u00fcnderkind, and 1 from either <a href=\"/en/card/02064\">Doppelg\u00e4nger</a> or <a href=\"/en/card/02028\">Dyson Mem Chip</a>. With a setup like that, we can get past <em>anything</em>. And to get to it, we'll just scour the net for people letting us take their code for a <a href=\"/en/card/02047\">Test Run</a>, or go on a <a href=\"/en/card/01034\">Diesel</a> binge and see what's left when we're done tasting colours.</p>\n\n<p>Oh. Also, that <a href=\"/en/card/01039\">Rabbit Hole</a> | <a href=\"/en/card/02069\">Underworld Contact</a> synergy. That's neat too, I guess.</p>\n\n<p><em>Made with one Revised Core Set</em></p>\n",

Get Tollbooth and Hadrian's Wall rezzed with SanSan City Grid and some early Priority Requisition scores.</p>\n\n<p>Advance either real agendas or nasty bait with Shipment from Kaguya, or use it to bolster the two Wall ICEs. Tollbooth on your main scoring server and a judicious Closed Accounts will keep the runner poorer than is comfortable.</p>\n\n<p>Economy and draw shouldn't be a problem with the usual assets and operations, as well as Research Station and Anonymous Tip.</p>\n\n<p>A strong main scoring server with inconsistent assets and consistent damage output should keep the runner at bay and let you score agendas, or just spear them if they get too bold.</p>\n\n<p>Any and all feedback welcome!</p>\n",

Be smart not to fall prey to <a href=\"/en/card/01057\">Aggressive Secretaries</a>, if the advanced card in the remote looks easy to access, call their bluff and don't run it.

Always keep them poor so they can't fire <a href=\"/en/card/01070\">Snares</a> or <a href=\"/en/card/01069\">Junebugs</a>. They have enough to fire snares? Land an Account Siphon and roam free. Use <a href=\"/en/card/01049\">Infiltration</a> for dangerous remote servers. <a href=\"/en/card/01029\">Bank Job</a> works great against them. You can even go Tag-Denial since they don't have ways to punish tags aside a scored <a href=\"/en/card/01107\">Private Security Force</a>. Never run with less than 3 cards (Snare!) and never end a turn with an empty hand or <a href=\"/en/card/01072\">Neural EMP</a> goes pew-pew.</li>\n<li>[NBN]: Remove tags immediately for they might carry <a href=\"/en/card/01099\">Scorched Earth</a> and other nasty stuff such as <a href=\"/en/card/01084\">Closed Accounts</a> / <a href=\"/en/card/01085\">Psychographics</a>. ICE is not dangerous and economy is weak. Face-check everything and try to lock their R&amp;D.</li>\n<li>[Weyland]: Remove tags immediately. <a href=\"/en/card/01099\">SE</a> can ruin your game. Not easy to keep them poor so improve your table until they build their remote fort and use <a href=\"/en/card/01021\">Inside Job</a>. <a href=\"/en/card/01020\">Forged Activation Orders</a> is nice early game to get rid of \"investment\" ICE like <a href=\"/en/card/01101\">Archer</a>, <a href=\"/en/card/01102\">Hadrian's Wall</a> etc...</li>\n</ul>",

I used only one core set and each of the deluxe expansions to make at least one decklist for every ID available in the Core Set and each deluxe. Obviously a handful of the IDs do not have the support to shine in this limited cardpool, but I tried my best. These decklists exist in a bubble, so \u201cMeta\u201d picks are hard to judge (Sharon Claire and/or Cyberdex Virus Suite vs. Noise, Damage protection for runners), so that\u2019s pretty much for you to decide. For anyone questioning how much fun you can get out of 1 Core and 4 Deluxes, I hope they can have as much fun with these lists as I did making them.</p>\n",

But of course, from there, some tricks had to be added in to grab interest and show the tension in the game.</p>\n\n<p>The first thing I want new Runners to understand is how uncertain and unsafe things can be, and you have to learn how to measure risks. Definitely a few traps, especially Jinteki traps to help teach that faction's major identity.</p>\n\n<p>I wanted to cover all of the mechanics, to Traces were included, as well as cards that can utilizes tags beyond trashing resources. It's a basic deck, but much more dangerous than an HB: Stronger Together build, or just one focused on ICE and Agendas. Not sure how best to start a player out, but I think this covers all the bases and gives an idea of what each faction can do and how they can mix.</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>Like many newbies after a couple of months of playing online and with a friend, I decide it was time to find a local store championship to test out my skill. Feeling very nervous at first as only had a single core set and not really sure what to expect but it turned out great as many before me has stated in a many forums that the core set really has a lot of good cards.</p>\n\n<p>Firstly let talk about the deck and please fell free to advice/comment as my selections are due to my current limited card pool (1 core set only), knowledge and experience.</p>\n\n<p>Runner: Criminal Gabriel</p>\n\n<p>Why did I built this deck?\nWell after playing testing all 3 runner factions in the core set, Criminal just seem to best suit me. Shaper- Kate seem too slow and deliberating. Anarch - Noise - I could not quite get it going it with need for lowering ICE strengths etc. Too much room for error when playing a first tournament.</p>\n\n<p>Strengths:\nRun early and run hard but with a degree of safety in mind that the Criminal way. Not really relying on any resource it doesn't matter if you hit a bad ICE at the start. Every breaker is doubled up and hence not end of world gets trashed. </p>\n\n<p>Weakness: \nI feel against Jinteki is the worst matchup as too many net damage and potential servers run to make it run out of money fast. Also no breakers for traps or non-standard ICE.</p>\n\n<p>Card Selection:\nAll Econ of Sure Gamble, Bank Job, Armitage CodeBusting, Easy Mark are self explanatory, need money to break ICE, thats the key hence added Cyberfeeder to assist. \nAccount Siphon - any criminal deck without this, try to keep Corp in checek whist boosting yourself obvious choice with the inclusion on Crash Space and Decoy to help pay or avoid tags. Crash Space is my primary choice but had use Decoy to fill out deck. Crash Space is also an excellent counter against Scorched Earth and Traffic Accident.\nForced Activation - use when Corp is low on econ is great way to trash, else use up Corp money.\nDesperado - the best console in Core set such a good econ feeder\nDataDealer - this was a last minute swap in as on Jinteki.net play testing, I keep getting bad agenda ambush - proved very useful in my Round 2 Game 2. Getting rid of a News Team for 9 credit - works better than a stimhack.\nBreaker Suite - Simply and effective - Corroder/Femme/GorianBlade, covers the basis. Ninja if up against high sentry but usually only acting as filler or early game install before femme. Use Femme to bypass Tollbooth is a must else even with Gorian Blade it is expensive 7 credit to break. Sneakbackdoor useful if Corp leaves archive open or with low ICE.</p>\n\n<p>Netrunner Spring 2016 Store Tournament Report </p>\n\n<p>Date: 21st may 2016<br />\nVenue: TheHobbitHole - Chatteris\nFormat: Swiss rounds 3</p>\n\n<p>My Corporation deck can be found &lt;<a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/35410/hb-etf-core-only\">https://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/35410/hb-etf-core-only</a>&gt;</p>\n\n<p>Round 1 Game 1: HB ETF vs Kate (Lose, 0pt)\nVery slow start, pretty much agenda bomb had 3 agendas in my hand most of the time and lost pretty quick apart from scoring an early agenda. Unable to tags and the runner keep trashing my Adonis Campaign to keep me poor. \nAgenda 2-7</p>\n\n<p>Round 1 Game 2: Gabriel VS NEH (Modified Win, 1pt) \nThis was pressure game, running like criminal does, early and hard on HQ, scored a couple of points and then the Corp rallied. Agenda was 2-3 when time was called just after he installed an agenda into server leaving me with one last hoorah run. First click, Account Siphon to make Corp poor and not enough to rez next runs set of ICEs and then to take further tag on Data Raven to score additional 2 pt agenda for the modified 1 points win and leaving opponent with 0. </p>\n\n<p>Agenda 4-3 </p>\n\n<p>End of Round 1 Score: 1pt</p>\n\n<p>Round 2 Game 1: HB ETF vs Noise (Win, 2pts)\nThis is a very quick game. I opened scoring a Private Security Force on an open server on turn as runner was only interested in milling R&amp;D into archives and upping the virus counters with incubator and medium. He was that confident he even float tags without batting an eye lid even when running on R&amp;D against my Data Raven. He went 6-2 up in no time and with pressure on I had to change tactic. Firstly waste a turn to purge virus and then another turn do a 3-click meat damage with my scored Private Security Force to help reduce his attack options as he was breaking with Faust. He didn't care as he had worse (Anarch = I Had Worse) and was gaining 3 cards when I was doing meat damage, but eventually slip up when he was too eager and left with 2 cards in hand after missing a 4 card medium dig. PSF killed with 3 click meat damage. </p>\n\n<p>Agenda 2-6 but Runner flatlined</p>\n\n<p>Round 2 Game 2: Gabriel vs NEH (Modified Win, 1pt)\nA very fast start from Corp in getting Breaking News for the single point lead and then ambushing me with News Team for -1 agenda. I had to keep the Corp poor as he was quick with remote servers and asset. AS to the rescue. With the econ battle in my favour I could risk both snares and ghost branch then using crash space to pay for tags and finally finding desperado and data dealer to get rid of 2 News Team which was turning point and went on to win the game on 5-2 after time was called. </p>\n\n<p>Agenda 5-2</p>\n\n<p>End of Round 2 Score: 4pts</p>\n\n<p>Round 3 Game 1: Gabriel vs Replicating Perfection (Win, 2pts)\nFeeling more at home and relaxed the cards just seem to come at the right time. The corp had an agenda rush and no econ as I AS and then constant run on HQ with Desperado together with a open server explosion agenda to finish quick. </p>\n\n<p>Agenda 8-0</p>\n\n<p>Round 3 Game 2: HB ETF vs Kate (Win, 2pts)\nWith confidence up, I knew I was in with a chance of top to two. Brilliant first hand with Shipment for Mirrormorph to install 3 ICE, Adonis Campaigning and Hedge Funds. 10 credits and runner was slow to setup leaving lots of earlier opportunities - when 4-0 up then played for ABT which could have been a costly move; sending 2 agenda into archives. I could only protect with Tollboth at the time and later spend the next few turns bulking up archives but was too late. Runner soon caught up to 6-5. But as he went for the finish he hit an Ichi with no sentry breakers. Next turn install ABT, but I was limited in money down to 7 with 2 unrezzed ice Engina and Rototurret. The runner was clever forcing me to use my money even if he couldn't in. Luckily I had a Pad Campaign already rezzed and 2 shipment from kaaguya in hand to score out.  </p>\n\n<p>Agenda 7-5</p>\n\n<p>End of Round 3 Score: 8pts</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>Just like everyone else, I started learning to play A:NR with Jinteki Vs. Kate (as the rulebook suggests). I played too many games as corp only with a single runner friend (playing Kate of course) and I always felt so poor. Not many ways to make <span class=\"icon icon-credit\"></span>credits other than <span class=\"icon icon-click\"></span>clicking for it or <a href=\"/en/card/01110\">Hedge Fund</a> if I'm lucky enough, while on the other side there was a juicy <a href=\"en/card/01044\">Magnum Opus</a> for up to 8cr per turn. Frustrated as I was, I started researching for my first deckbuilding. Rules were simple enough regarding Agendas and Influence, but I still couldn't make my core <a href=\"en/card/01067\">Jinteki</a> deck rich enough. How can I protect myself if I can't pay 4<span class=\"icon icon-credit\"></span> for a <a href=\"/en/card/01070\">Snare!</a> or advance a <a href=\"/en/card/01069\">Project Junebug</a>? </p>\n\n<p>And so I went exploring other factions and Voila...<a href=\"/en/card/01093\">Weyland</a> and its attractive ability: 1 extra <span class=\"icon icon-credit\"></span> for each transaction operation...Then I thought about it and the most you can make out of the whole deck is 6<span class=\"icon icon-credit\"></span>! <a href=\"/en/card/01054\">HB</a> is way richer and became my first glacier corp. Flatlining was never my go-to strategy, but the more games I played, the more I understood that at some point the runner can lock you out of a scoring window and there must be a plan B. Weyland has <a href=\"/en/card/01099\">Scorched Earth</a>!</p>\n\n<p>I must admit, playing Jinteki PE the main plan is flatlining and I wasn't taking risks mandatory for a shell game, with multiple servers of open traps and open agendas. I didn't understand that and turned to HB for a glacier approach, with most of my games ending with a tower of ICE on a single server, sometimes up to 5 cards of different subtypes (avoiding more than two Code Gates, because of <a href=\"en/card/01043\">Gordian Blade's</a> ability keeping its strength). A Code Gate plus a couple of Barriers and maaaybe a Sentry somewhere in the fort, worked best. I usually avoid sentries in the beginning because they lack ETR and the runner usually runs naked in the beginning. </p>\n\n<p>Long story short, my deck was packed with ICE and economy, Adonis, Melange, PADs, Beanstalks, Hedge Funds. Nothing else, no traps, no tagging, not even upgrades. No plan B! If the runner could manage to keep me poor, scoring plan goes bye bye. Weyland on the other hand can follow the same glacier approach but also be capable of killing the runner. </p>\n\n<p>Out of the box there are limited was to tag the runner though, aside from <a href=\"/en/card/01112\">Hunter</a> or forfeiting a <a href=\"/en/card/01095\">Posted Bounty</a>, which is usually more of a miss than a hit. Runner sees advanced card, runner steals. NBN to the rescue. I borrowed a few cards that can help tag the runner and before he's able to clear the tag...drop a satellite on his house. The classic <a href=\"/en/card/01086\">SEA</a>/<a href=\"/en/card/01099\">Scorched</a>/<a href=\"/en/card/01099\">Scorched</a> combo. Weyland glacier games usually last longer, so combo pieces are not so difficult to be found. Make the runner respect your <a href=\"/en/card/01088\">Data Ravens</a>, <a href=\"/en/card/01112\">Hunters</a> and <a href=\"/en/card/01104\">Shadows</a>.</p>\n",

Of course I'm happy if someone gives advice how to improve it and I'm open to suggestions.</p>\n\n<p>The idea is to get the runner as many tags as possible to score the agendas with <a href=\"/en/card/01085\">Psychographics</a> in one turn. <a href=\"/en/card/01088\">Data Raven</a> , <a href=\"/en/card/01089\">Matrix Analyzer</a> and SEA Source should keep the runner tagged, while once tagged <a href=\"/en/card/01099\">Scorched Earth</a>, <a href=\"/en/card/01107\">Private Security Force</a> and <a href=\"/en/card/01084\">Closed Accounts</a> should keep him at distance.

The recommended starter decks in the core set aren\u2019t very efficient nor do they use any influence, so I have worked with some friends to design a few starter decks. Every starter deck is made of a single core set and we have also made variants with no 1-of cards so anyone with 3 core-sets can throw together these starter decks and have them lying around to introduce new players. We have tested the Beginner decks against each other and the Intermediate decks against each other and they are pretty balance with the runner winning slightly more often.</p>\n\n<p>Beginner decks are designed for players just picking up the game. They are straight forward and have very little tricks.</p>\n\n<p>Intermediate decks introduce players to more complex and interesting concepts such as search, traps, and viruses.</p>\n\n<p>Advanced decks are your own decks that you design and build. Get familiar with the other factions and cards. Experiment and have fun!</p>\n\n<p>This deck introduces traps and damage. The Corp will also have to play smart since most of the ICE is not that expensive to break or doesn\u2019t stop the runner. Upgrades are also introduced with Akitaro Watanabe (unless you are making the no 1-ofs version). The Corp will have to learn smart ICE placement, money management, and timing. The Runner will have to learn when it is safe to run and how to reduce risk of flatlining.</p>\n\n<p>To make this deck with no 1-ofs.\n-1 Akitaro Watanabe\n+1 Enigma</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>People often ask for starter decks when they first get Netrunner to get an idea of how to deck build or what makes a deck strong. The recommended starter decks in the core set aren\u2019t very efficient nor do they use any influence, so I have worked with some friends to design a few starter decks. Every starter deck is made of a single core set and we have also made variants with no 1-of cards so anyone with 3 core-sets can throw together these starter decks and have them lying around to introduce new players. We have tested the Beginner decks against each other and the Intermediate decks against each other and they are pretty balance with the runner winning slightly more often.</p>\n\n<p>Beginner decks are designed for players just picking up the game. They are straight forward and have very little tricks.</p>\n\n<p>Intermediate decks introduce players to more complex and interesting concepts such as search, traps, and viruses.</p>\n\n<p>Advanced decks are your own decks that you design and build. Get familiar with the other factions and cards. Experiment and have fun!</p>\n\n<p>This deck was designed to introduce players to some of the more interesting programs such as static breakers (Yog.0 and Mimic) as well as viruses. We also introduce search with Special Order, ICE destruction with Parasite, and card synergy (Datasucker with static breakers and Parasite). Noise\u2019s ability also makes things interesting for the Corp as they will have to learn to also protect Archives from attack.</p>\n\n<p>To make this deck with no 1-ofs.\n-1 Grimoire\n-1 Ice Carver\n+2 Stimhack</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>This Shaper Deck can be build with 1 Core Set and it is designed only for casual play and discovery of ANR (Core set bloody battles only).  Please remember this :) </p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Why Mac Again ?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>A lot of new players seems comfortable with Ka... Mac (You call her Kate too, isn't ?).  She sacrifices refinement for efficiency : A strong economy, three types of IceBreaker, \"Tinkering\" who changes problem in solution, a strong heavy console, ... and the three neutral cards \"Infiltration\" help a lot to avoid traps and choose runs (and for self-confidence).  Not bad at all.\nBut I made a few changes.  They helped me a lot during my long hours of core set battles (against Weyland mainly).  They provide little more versatility without altering the spirit of the base deck : \"<em>HELLO GUYS, I'M HERE FOR YOU</em>\". *BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>How It Goes</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>I used 15 points of influence precisely to splash 7 different cards from Anarchs &amp; Criminals for a total of 45 cards.  Yes, 7 different cards.  Like I said I injected versatility not \"the perfect card in triplicate\".  This is a personal choice.  Let's take a look :</p>\n\n<ul><li><p>Bank Job (Criminal) : Bank Job will put pressure on the new corp player (same level as you I suppose).  A lot of PAD Campaign in remote servers isn't ? \"Please waste your money for ICE's or I'll make easy money myself\".  An ICE in front of a remote server is not in front of a central server obviously --&gt; GO R&amp;D / GO HQ !  For a core set play between beginners this is a win-win situation for me.\nBonus 1 : You sniff a trap ?  You take the money without accessing cards !\nBonus 2 : No remote server for now ?  Place Bank Job on your station and look the pale face of your opponent.  Mind Game.\nBonus 3 : Take 7 credits.  Not 8.  Later, trash the card with Aesop and gain 3 credits.  yeeepa.</p></li>\n<li><p>Account Siphon (Criminal) : Acc. Siph. will put pressure on the corp player.  Again.  His precious money.  Again !  Here is the thing: The run is successful and you reinforce YOUR economy while ruining his credit pool.  Or the run is unsuccessful because the corp player has paid ICE's.  He trashed credits and you win precious informations on HQ defenses.  Furthermore ICE's paid in front of HQ means less money for remote servers' ICE's.  GO RUN THERE.  GO BANK JOB.\nNote : A day your opponent will realize he can spend money (Assets, ...) during your run.  The spirit stay the same.  Less money for him (Other solution : #meninblack #neuralizer).</p></li>\n</ul><p>For me the combination of both is more effective than two cards of the same type.</p>\n\n<ul><li><p>Forged Activation Order (Criminal) : Let's continue with anoter \"economy / information\" game.  The corp player must rez an unrezzed ICE or trash it.  And of course he must pay the price if he choose to rez it.  You get the point h\u00e9 ? :)  Play it when his credit pool is empty and bye-bye ICE.  Play it when he has money and force him to discard credits (and gain precious information ^^) or trash.  Do this early in your turn and you can run on your new prey.  He rezzed a super heavy ICE ?  Go run elsewhere, he has less credits to pay the others ICE's.</p></li>\n<li><p>Cyberfeeder (Anarchs) : Well... Mac trash only one credit to pay this Hardware who give one credit for one Icebreaker EACH TURN.  A free credit for a run each turn.  Make 10 runs and you'll save 10 credits.  More than a Bank Job reward!  Look at your opponent and use the credit loudly: first he will not see it as a threat...  After a few runs he's going to hate this little tiny credit.  You take his money from everywhere and you do success runs with a little credit, oh my god ! (Of course you are using more credits to successfully run.  I know that.  But don't neglect the minds battle.  You can win with it !  More than once).  Personally: When a round is quieter I put this on the station.  Never useless.  Never.  Both of them are better but life is full of choices.\nPsy-bonus: OH !  And you'll pay finally only one credit with your Battering Ram to pass this one routine ICE.  I call it self-satisfaction.  The benefit of self-satisfaction goes beyond the game.  Cardiologist words.</p></li>\n<li><p>D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu (Anarchs) : 2 credits and you take back something from the heap. <em>Epileptic crisis</em>.  Your best joker.  Basically : do what you want with it.  Program trashed ?  Take it back.  No more money ?  Revive Armitage.  A lot of credits in the corp pool again ?  Account Siphon, the come-back.  An defenseless remote server ?  Bank Job, revenge of the son.  You sniff a trap ?  Re-infiltration.  I think you get the idea... </p></li>\n<li><p>Stimhack (Anarchs) :  You are a little short money for your ultimate run ?  Who cares !  use this 9 free credits to run and win the game !  A brain damage ?  Who cares ?  You won the game !</p></li>\n<li><p>Ice Carver (Anarchs) : lol.  \"Please, don't hate me\".  </p></li>\n</ul><p><strong><em>Some Modifications</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Well... two or three thoughts... :</p>\n\n<ul><li>Why three gordian blades ?  Two is good.</li>\n<li>Why three Crypsis ?  Two is good.  Go for one if you want change something in the deck: You've back-up with 6 Icebreakers.</li>\n<li>Why Three Armitage ?  With two Magnum Opus you 're good.  The two armitage are here to prevent a double-Magnum-Opus-bottom-deck situation.  Not self-confident ?  -1 Crypsis +1 Armitage.  But when your first Magnum we'll be activated you will have 3 dead cards.  4 if the corp player don't erase your first Magnum Opus...  With the economy sub-game of this deck I prefer to have a Crypsis in order to relieve a Icebreaker missing situation.  Note: The three Tinkering are a good argument against the previous sentence. </li>\n<li>You can replace the Icebreakers if you want.  But you will pay with your influence and... and this page becomes useless lol. </li>\n<li>Yes.  I don't keep the two rabbit holes.  The Toolbox give the same bonus.  Against NBN or a Tag Deck you MAY want to change this.  Your choice.  With 3 points (Mac has 1 point + Console 2 points) a good economy and sucking the corp money I prefer an outbidding mind game during the trace protocol.</li>\n<li>1 Net Shield.  Mmmh.  Not sure about that.  Zero ?  Two ?  I am psychologically comfortable with one.</li>\n<li>2 Akametsu Mep Chip.  Yep.  Very useful when the Toolbox play hide-&amp;-seek.  Console on ?  Aesop !</li>\n<li>3 Diesel are essential.  No tutor here so sometimes you must dig.</li>\n<li>The Maker's Eye is dangerous with traps (Jinteki).  But R&amp;D stay the best server to steal Agenda.</li>\n<li>Toolbox costs you a kidney.  Dont use Modded to install a Gordian Blade ;)</li>\n<li>Others cards speak for themselves.</li>\n<li>Mac special ability is powerful and you have a good economy (depending of runs...).  Try to make profits by installing one program or hardware / round (depending of emergencies).</li>\n</ul><p><strong><em>Last Thought</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>This deck is designed to learn ANR and slowly start to play with several parts of the game: Build a powerful \"not-so-subtle\" station, manage the opponent's economy not just yours, gain informations, put the pressure on different type of servers, do other things than just hunt Agenda, ...  So it must be used again an another core set deck, obviously.\nI hope someone will have fun with it.  Don't hesitate to comment.  Thank you to consider that this is my first deckbuilding and that English is not my language. :)</p>\n",

    "description": "<p><strong>DISCLAIMER</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>Recently I just got my interest bloomed in A: NR and decided to begin my journey in this LCG game. This is my first experience in building decks, so this deck would be condemned as <strong>sub-par</strong>, <strong>sub standard</strong>, <strong>lousy</strong>, etc. I do not hope for praises, but I would really appreciate criticism and recommendation. I would start from casual (with of course limitation from NAPD Wanted List on mind) and one day I will achieve something competitively.</p>\n\n<h1><strong>Strategy</strong></h1>\n\n<p>The first thing in my mind after I read the rules and <a href=\"/en/card/01001\">Noise</a>'s ability is <strong>how to steal agenda while also thinning out the Corporation's R&amp;D pile</strong>. <strong>CMIIW</strong> but there are no other Virus cards owned by other factions except Anarch and <a href=\"/en/card/01051\">Crypsis</a> in the core set (?) Thus, my choice is limited into these cards:</p>\n\n<ul><li>3x <a href=\"/en/card/01051\">Crypsis</a></li>\n<li>3x <a href=\"/en/card/01008\">Datasucker</a></li>\n<li>3x <a href=\"/en/card/01010\">Medium</a></li>\n<li>2x <a href=\"/en/card/01012\">Parasite</a></li>\n</ul><p>If, <strong>hypothetically speaking</strong>, the Runner is able, <strong>somehow</strong>, to install all these 11 Virus Programs, these would thin out by <span class=\"icon icon-trash\"></span> <strong>in average 24,4% R&amp;D pile</strong> (the average minimum cards in the deck is about 45). Simultaneously, when the Corporation is not careful (read: <strong>thin ICE defence on Archives</strong>), then <a href=\"/en/card/01001\">Noise</a> would punish by <strong>spending 1<span class=\"icon icon-click\"></span> and running on the mentioned server</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Now, let's do the math. In the most ideal case to do a successful run, the programs installed should be about this:</p>\n\n<ul><li>1x <a href=\"/en/card/01007\">Corroder</a>: 2<span class=\"icon icon-credit\"></span> and 1<span class=\"icon icon-mu\"></span></li>\n<li>1x <a href=\"/en/card/01051\">Crypsis</a>: 5<span class=\"icon icon-credit\"></span> and 1<span class=\"icon icon-mu\"></span></li>\n<li>1x <a href=\"/en/card/01014\">Yog.0</a>: 5<span class=\"icon icon-credit\"></span> and 1<span class=\"icon icon-mu\"></span></li>\n<li>1x <a href=\"/en/card/01008\">Datasucker</a>: 1<span class=\"icon icon-credit\"></span> and 1<span class=\"icon icon-mu\"></span></li>\n<li>1x <a href=\"/en/card/01012\">Parasite</a>: 2<span class=\"icon icon-credit\"></span> and 1<span class=\"icon icon-mu\"></span></li>\n</ul><p>In total, <a href=\"/en/card/01001\">Noise</a> needs <strong>minimum 15<span class=\"icon icon-credit\"></span> and 5<span class=\"icon icon-mu\"></span>. This is why <a href=\"/en/card/01044\">Magnum Opus</a> and <a href=\"/en/card/01009\">Djinn</a> must be really included in the deck.</strong> Period.</p>\n\n<h1><strong>Card Breakdown</strong></h1>\n\n<h2>Event</h2>\n\n<ol><li><p><a href=\"/en/card/01002\">D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu</a> would be really helpful to search 2 virus cards and take it to the grip, ready to be installed and thinning out the R&amp;D pile.</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"/en/card/01003\">Demolition Run</a> is to trash dangerous ICE and other problematic cards that usually cannot be trashed. Plus, it costs only 2<span class=\"icon icon-credit\"></span> to trash those cards.</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"/en/card/01020\">Forged Activation Orders</a> is really good, especially when the Corporation has insufficient <span class=\"icon icon-credit\"></span> at hand. Say good bye to expensive and powerful ICE.</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"/en/card/01049\">Infiltration</a> is really helpful to build economy. I will abuse this card to gain more <span class=\"icon icon-credit\"></span>.</p></li>\n<li><a href=\"/en/card/01035\">Modded</a> is useful to reduce the cost for expensive cards such as <a href=\"/en/card/01014\">Yog.0</a> and <a href=\"/en/card/01044\">Magnum Opus</a>.</li>\n</ol><h2>Hardware</h2>\n\n<ol><li><p><a href=\"/en/card/01005\">Cyberfeeder</a> compensates 1<span class=\"icon icon-credit\"></span> per turn when <a href=\"/en/card/01001\">Noise</a> needs to install Virus or use Icebreakers.</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"/en/card/01006\">Grimoire</a> helps a lot to save <span class=\"icon icon-click\"></span> that usually used for placing 1 virus counter and also giving additional 2<span class=\"icon icon-mu\"></span>.</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"/en/card/01040\">The Personal Touch</a> is a non-Anarch card that is proven to help those Icebreakers that could not be strengthened up by spending <span class=\"icon icon-credit\"></span>.</p></li>\n</ol><h2>Resource</h2>\n\n<ol><li><p><a href=\"/en/card/01052\">Access to Globalsec</a> will really reduce the cost to prevent <a href=\"/en/card/01001\">Noise</a> getting tagged.</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"/en/card/01053\">Armitage Codebusting</a> is an alternative when <a href=\"/en/card/01044\">Magnum Opus</a> is not there.</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"/en/card/01015\">Ice Carver</a> helps to break ICE.</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"/en/card/01048\">Sacrificial Construct</a> is your escape route to prevent the Corporation trashing important program or hardware.</p></li>\n</ol><h2>Icebreaker</h2>\n\n<p>This part is actually quite self-explanatory. Nonetheless, there is something that should be mentioned here: (<strong>More likely this being a question from me</strong>)</p>\n\n<p>When <a href=\"/en/card/01051\">Crypsis</a> is already installed, I do not think <a href=\"/en/card/01011\">Mimic</a> would be useful, though. <strong>Q: Should I just take these cards away, then?</strong></p>\n\n<h2>Programs</h2>\n\n<ol><li><p><a href=\"/en/card/01008\">Datasucker</a> is a must because several Icebreakers are not able to be boosted up by spending <span class=\"icon icon-credit\"></span>.</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"/en/card/01009\">Djinn</a> will be really a good complimentary to <a href=\"/en/card/01006\">Grimoire</a> because it gives additional 2<span class=\"icon icon-mu\"></span> free and this card is really essential in a virus deck. It helps finding another virus cards when needed.</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"/en/card/01044\">Magnum Opus</a> is self-explanatory.</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"/en/card/01010\">Medium</a> is really great to access more cards from the R&amp;D pile. **Warning!! Please be careful with traps such as <a href=\"/en/card/01070\">Snare!</a>.</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"/en/card/01012\">Parasite</a> is idem with <a href=\"/en/card/01008\">Datasucker</a>. Would be a good combo.</p></li>\n</ol><h1>End Note</h1>\n\n<p>I do really need recommendations and also the chance to play test this deck. I live in Kassel, Germany. Anyone who is patient enough and really willing to be a good mentor could really be a valuable resource for me to catch up because I am 5 years late to start playing this game. I know I need a lot to learn and I really would like to play better and better.</p>\n\n<p>Recommendations regarding which data packs I need to get, how should I prepare for rotation, and what is missing and redundant in my strategy and playing style would be really appreciated!</p>\n\n<p>N.B. I have bought 3 core sets!! :( Anyone who is willing to sell their first and second cycles so I do not have to buy the revised core set will be accepted too!</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>A:NR rule-book suggests that beginner runners should start with <a href=\"/en/card/01033\">Kate</a>. Maybe that's because Shapers use easier to follow tactics and straightforward strategies. They seem also more powerful due to Kate's ability and general economy. Criminals are the kings of tricks, also quite easy to maneuver. After a lot of deck-building, and experimentation with all 3 IDs within the core set, <a href=\"/en/card/01001\">Noise</a> is my least favorite runner. Very exciting and chaotic in the beginning, but kind of weak out of the core box and possible to lock out by the corp. Don't get me wrong, Noise is one of my favorite IDs but he needs a few Data Packs to become more powerful by exploiting his milling ability. I made this deck in order to help beginners understand the chaotic/destructive ways of Anarchs.</p>\n\n<h1>Hardware + Icebreakers</h1>\n\n<ul><li>2x <a href=\"/en/card/01007\">Corroder</a> (Barriers)</li>\n<li>2x <a href=\"/en/card/01014\">Yog.0</a> (Code gates)</li>\n<li>2x <a href=\"/en/card/01011\">Mimic</a> (Sentries)</li>\n<li>2x <a href=\"/en/card/01051\">Crypsis</a> (AI)</li>\n</ul><p>Notice that half the breaking suit is fixed and can't be pumped to a certain strength. That's what <a href=\"/en/card/01008\">Datasuckers</a> &amp; <a href=\"/en/card/01015\">Ice Carver</a> are for. <a href=\"/en/card/01013\">Wyrm</a> might look like a good idea to a beginner, but forget that card...worst card ever printed, what a waste of ink! Fill up those Datasuckers and run big sentries or taxing code gates like [Tollbooth] like it's nothing. The corporation will be more than willing to purge virus counters in order to lock you out. <a href=\"/en/card/01051\">Crypsis</a> is there for such a case and can be tutored just like any virus program via <a href=\"/en/card/01009\">Djinn</a>. Quite a bad card for Shapers and Crims but excellent for Noise!</p>\n\n<p>Facecheck ICE. Best case scenario = EtR (end the run). Worst case scenario = Net Damage and Noise won't mind a few net casualties in order to <a href=\"/en/card/01012\">Parasite</a> said ICE and destroy it with the help of <a href=\"/en/card/01008\">Datasucker</a>. <a href=\"/en/card/01022\">Special Order</a> will tutor what's needed. </p>\n\n<p>The program suite is quite big and far more than the starting 4<span class=\"icon icon-mu\"></span>. <a href=\"/en/card/01006\">Grimoire</a>, <a href=\"/en/card/01038\">Akamatsu Mem Chip</a> will provide with extra <span class=\"icon icon-mu\"></span> and <a href=\"/en/card/01009\">Djinn</a> will take care of the rest.</p>\n\n<p>If you're lucky enough to draw <a href=\"/en/card/01047\">Aesop's Pawnshop</a> install immediately. Noise's ability can work about 7 times (1 Crypsis, 2 Datasuckers, 1 Medium, 3 Parasites). With Pawnshop, you can sell a virus, install an other one, sell that too and bring them both back with <a href=\"/en/card/01002\">D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu</a>. Rinse repeat. 1/4 of Corp's deck can be milled not counting <a href=\"/en/card/01003\">Demolition Run</a>.</p>\n\n<h1>Economy &amp; card draw</h1>\n\n<ul><li>3x <a href=\"/en/card/01050\">Sure Gamble</a> - burst 12<span class=\"icon icon-credit\"></span></li>\n<li>2x <a href=\"/en/card/01018\">Account Siphon</a> - 6-10<span class=\"icon icon-credit\"></span> profit; up to you if you want to go Tag-Denial.

Be smart not to fall prey to <a href=\"/en/card/01057\">Aggressive Secretaries</a>, if the advanced card in the remote looks easy to access, call their bluff and don't run it. Looks like a scoring window? <a href=\"/en/card/01004\">Stimhack!</a>.</li>\n<li>[Jinteki]: Try and keep them poor by face-checking ice, so they can't fire <a href=\"/en/card/01070\">Snares</a> or <a href=\"/en/card/01069\">Junebugs</a>. They have enough to fire snares? Land an Account Siphon and roam free. Use <a href=\"/en/card/01049\">Infiltration</a> for dangerous remote servers. You can even go Tag-Denial since they don't have ways to punish tags aside a scored <a href=\"/en/card/01107\">Private Security Force</a>. Never run with less than 3 cards (Snare!) and never end a turn with an empty hand or <a href=\"/en/card/01072\">Neural EMP</a> goes pew-pew.</li>\n<li>[NBN]: Remove tags immediately for they might carry <a href=\"/en/card/01099\">Scorched Earth</a> and other nasty stuff such as <a href=\"/en/card/01084\">Closed Accounts</a> / <a href=\"/en/card/01085\">Psychographics</a>.

    "description": "<p>Won a 9-person tournament with this deck. The event was using only 1x Revised Core, and it was a ton of fun to return to the fundamentals of Netrunner. Despite people, myself included, lamenting some of the choices for the Revised Core, it felt like a pretty solid experience.</p>\n\n<p>As for the deck, you don't get much choice on the in-faction cards so I'll focus on the imports. I picked Weyland because I have a soft spot for green and I thought the extra cash would really pay off. Green Level Clearance was nice to get that early momentum going. Tollbooth is there because my main scoring plan was to tax the running out. Definitely did work in every game. Always had enough money to rez one, often two, thanks to operations and GRNDL Refineries. AggSec is for when the runner gets their breakers out and your left wondering how to score. Won me one game on the day. MVPs were the Trick of Lights. Advancing ICE throughout the game so I could finish off my game with a fast advance was my strategy every game, and it worked.  </p>\n\n<p>Beat 2 Shapers and 2 Criminals, going 4-0. The key was really rushing out and over-advancing Atlases early. Turn out it's a good card.</p>\n\n<p>Anyways, the event was a ton of fun and I definitely recommend you give it a go if you have the chance.</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>I played this deck at a beginners' tournament in London. The deck-building restriction was a single core set and single deluxe box of each player's choice, so I plumped for Order &amp; Chaos. I think my strategy for building went against the grain of my opponents: rather than taking as many pieces from the deluxe box as possible, I picked up my old core-set-only Weyland deck, looked at how it would work with Order &amp; Chaos options, and went from there. I played a fair amount beforehand against other Order &amp; Chaos decks, and some against Honor &amp; Profit, so went into the day pretty nervous about coming up against Creation &amp; Control. </p>\n\n<p>The basic strategy of the deck is fairly similar to core-set Weyland (in my humble experience) or Supermodernism, to a certain extent: go fast and start scoring behind binary end-the-run ice. This puts the runner in a horrid position: rush to fetch decoders and fracters to keep up (and risk ending a turn tagged or having one's rig wrecked by <a href=\"/en/card/01101\">Archer</a>) or watch as I continue to score out. Simple, no? I'm not reinventing the wheel here. I think that's why there are only 5 cards in the deck from Order &amp; Chaos (hmm, what does that say about that box? Sigh). <a href=\"/en/card/07018\">Fire Wall</a> works because it's taxing, it's etr, and it's cheaper than <a href=\"/en/card/01102\">Hadrian's Wall</a>. <a href=\"/en/card/07004\">Firmware Updates</a> plays to Argus's strength (taxing the run for every iddy-biddy point) and makes the two Walls even chunkier. Three advancements for the cost of advancing <a href=\"/en/card/07004\">Firmware</a> three times? Okay!</p>\n\n<p>On the day: I played four rounds of Swiss, and the deck went 3-1. Three match-ups against Noise, including one where all three virus mills were agendas into archives, and one against Kit. The three wins were all against Noise, even though I feared I've Had Worse would be sufficient <a href=\"/en/card/01099\">Scorch</a> protection.My experience of core-set Noise is that he sets up slower than other IDs and I could rush to win. <a href=\"/en/card/01070\">Snare!</a>, as ever, did excellent work weeding out aforementioned IHW and disincentivising runs. <a href=\"/en/card/01095\">Posted Bounty</a> forfeiture seems also highly underrated, in my small experience. As a runner, you simply cannot afford to leave a double advanced card in a remote for a turn. But do you really want to run through a <a href=\"/en/card/01088\">Data Raven</a> or <a href=\"/en/card/07017\">Checkpoint</a> to take a look? </p>\n\n<p>The loss came to Kit. Turn one, my opponent installed a Decoy, of all things, and even though I'd begun the game with <a href=\"/en/card/01095\">Posted Bounty</a> and Scorch in hand, it became a race to score out. I scored 6 points, all 1-pointers, which seemed fairly laughable, and saw only 6 pieces of ICE all game. The deck's biggest weakness, I feel, is that against a wealthy runner who can summon breakers on the fly, Argus's tax is neglible and its servers porous. This basically proved correct.</p>\n\n<p>Nods to <a href=\"/en/card/01088\">Data Raven</a> for always evincing a sigh when opponents hit it, <a href=\"/en/card/07018\">Fire Wall</a> for being a nifty tax, <a href=\"/en/card/01070\">Snare!</a> for that 'I have to show you that' face runners pull a moment before they say it, and <a href=\"/en/card/01097\">Aggressive Negotiation</a> for being a son-of-a-gun. Maybe my favourite clutch play was leaving a double-advanced <a href=\"/en/card/01094\">Hostile Takeover</a> on the table for a turn, with AggNeg in hand, and my mandatory draw was... AggNeg. I scored <a href=\"/en/card/01094\">Hostile</a> out, played both the negotiations and sat back to admire my hand full of Scorched Earth, before remembering I had a click left...</p>\n\n<p>Compliments to my worthy, friendly, kind opponents and thanks to Dark Sphere and Tagore for organising. Ps not sure if this should be tagged as placing highly in a GNK but I've done it and you can shout me down!</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>Took to a newbie tournament that was core + 1 deluxe only. Placed 5th of 13, losing to the eventual 1st and 2nd place players</p>\n\n<p>In the run-up, I liked both my Jinteki (<a href=\"/en/card/05003\">Tennin Institute: The Secrets Within</a>) and Anarch decks, so needed to opt for either criminal to run or weyland to corp. In the end I opted for Anarch/Weyland - as did the majority of players at the tournament! I think this deck was fairly typical of what people went for, but I really enjoyed creating it with a faction I wasn't as confident with... it really felt like it was coming together towards tournament time. I particularly enjoyed discovering that a single <a href=\"/en/card/07027\">Cyberdex Virus Suite</a> in archives could put off a Noise runner!</p>\n\n<p>First game was against the eventual champion: <a href=\"http://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/25408/workhardplayhard\">Deck Here</a> ... and it came down to a final run on R&amp;D. I decided not to rez an archer protecting my R&amp;D on the final run, as I wanted to save the money to score out my double-advanced and heavily-protected agenda, but my opponent saw 2 cards, 1 of which was the final agenda he needed. This was my favourite game of the tournament.</p>\n\n<p>My second game was <a href=\"/en/card/01099\">Scorching</a> a relative newbie very late in the game (he had been playing for only a week or so), and my main anxiety was it going to time. Having said that, he started digging deep into my R&amp;D towards the end and I could have thrown it away - so I got lucky here, where I was unlucky in the previous game.</p>\n\n<p>My third game was fun but, sadly, it came down to a rules misunderstanding on my opponent's part - he got <a href=\"/en/card/01070\">Snared!</a> and I've Had Worse re-drew before it took all the damage.</p>\n\n<p>My final game was against a local 'rival'.\n<a href=\"http://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/25451/code-gate-delux\">Deck Here</a> After a frustrating runner game against him, he outplayed me this game. This included reading me like a pamphlet, whenever I tried to place <a href=\"/en/card/01070\">Snare!</a>s/<a href=\"/en/card/07004\">Firmware Updates</a> out in the open (was a bit agenda flooded - a common problem without <a href=\"/en/card/04015\">Jackson Howard</a>)</p>\n\n<p>Overall, I was 2-2 for the day, but then I went home and beat my housemate at Football Manager Top Trumps, so came out up on the day. Thanks Terry Venables!</p>\n\n<p>Very friendly opponents and great games... 10/10, will tournament again.</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>This is a Single-Core teaching deck I use to introduce new players to Netrunner. This goes alongside my blogposts on the same subject: <a href=\"http://blog.nicelygroomedbeard.com/post/133873251128/learning-netrunner-1011\">Learning Netrunner 101</a></p>\n\n<p>This is <strong>first and foremost a teaching deck</strong>, this means that it may not be the most optimal Core Set deck you can build, but it will contain a lot of important concepts for teaching a new player the basics.</p>\n\n<hr /><h1>Events</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"/en/card/01034\">Diesel</a>: Drawing cards is one of the most important things you can do as a Runner. Use them a lot! Overdraw! You have multiple copies of nearly everything for a reason.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/en/card/01019\">Easy Mark</a>: While not a great card, new players will find themselves broke more often than not. This helps ease that pain.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/en/card/01049\">Infiltration</a>: New players will be afraid of everything that's face down, so this helps easy some of the mental strain. Afraid of that 2-advanced card? Expose it!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/en/card/01035\">Modded</a>: Huge money saver, works especially well with <a href=\"/en/card/01051\">Crypsis</a> <a href=\"/en/card/01026\">Femme Fatale</a>, or <a href=\"/en/card/01044\">Magnum Opus</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/en/card/01050\">Sure Gamble</a>: See Hedge Fund.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/en/card/01036\">The Maker's Eye</a>: Multiaccess is a very important concept to keep in mind in any of your decks, and The Maker's Eye does a great job at illustrating this. A single Maker's Eye can win the game.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/en/card/01037\">Tinkering</a>: Only have a <a href=\"/en/card/01007\">Corroder</a> out but that <a href=\"/en/card/01064\">Rototurret</a> is blocking your path? Tinker it into all types and then break it on the cheap.</p>\n\n<hr /><h1>Hardware</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"/en/card/01038\">Akamatsu Mem Chip</a>: More MU helps with <a href=\"/en/card/01044\">Magnum Opus</a> and holding onto extra <a href=\"/en/card/01008\">Datasuckers</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/en/card/01040\">The Personal Touch</a>: Goes great with <a href=\"/en/card/01051\">Crypsis</a> or <a href=\"/en/card/01046\">Pipeline</a>, as they have very low starting strengths.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/en/card/01041\">The Toolbox</a>: Mostly in this deck because it's cool. Also it gives <a href=\"/en/card/01035\">Modded</a> another target, and once it's installed you can discuss how recurring credits work.</p>\n\n<hr /><h1>Resources</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"/en/card/01053\">Armitage Codebusting</a>: Staple resource card, good to install when you don't need the money so you can tap on it later when you <em>do</em>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/en/card/01048\">Sacrificial Construct</a>: This will save your programs from mean Sentries, and can be used to extend the life of Crypsis.</p>\n\n<hr /><h1>Icebreakers</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"/en/card/01007\">Corroder</a>: The most effective barrier-breaker (Fracter) available. If you see a wall, start drawing through your deck until you find this beauty.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/en/card/01051\">Crypsis</a>: The hidden MVP of the Icebreakers. While you may not use them every turn, Crypsis with a virus counter on it is a threat the Corp cannot ignore.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/en/card/01026\">Femme Fatale</a>: The most \"wacky\" include in this decklist, and the one with the most confusing power. It also happens to be really powerful because of this power. Good for Runners to see as it shows that you won't have to break every piece of ICE you come across.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/en/card/01043\">Gordian Blade</a>: One of the few Icebreakers that retains its strength through the entirety of the run. It probably won't come up in any of these teaching games, but even outside of this power - it's one of the best Code Gate breakers (Decoder) out there.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/en/card/01046\">Pipeline</a>: Not a great card, but it goes to show you just how mean Sentries can get, even <em>breaking</em> them hurts (in credits).</p>\n\n<hr /><h1>Programs</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"/en/card/01008\">Datasucker</a>: It doesn't seem important at first, but once you get a token or two on board, it will do wonders with Parasite hanging around. It might also force the Corp to purge virus counters before they want to, leaving them with an effective dead turn.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/en/card/01044\">Magnum Opus</a>: Get this down fast, and start making money. Getting 2 credits per click is the gold standard of \"good amounts of credits per click\". Hefty Memory Unit cost though!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/en/card/01012\">Parasite</a>: When combined with Datasucker, this can destroy ICE quite quickly. Left on its own, it creates a slow-counting clock for the Corp. Either they watch the ICE die, or they install over that ICE, destroying it early for you.</p>\n\n<hr /><h1>Teachable Moments</h1>\n\n<p><strong>Use <a href=\"/en/card/01026\">Femme Fatale</a> to bypass a <a href=\"/en/card/01090\">Tollbooth</a>, avoiding the toll</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/en/card/01026\">Femme Fatale</a> and <a href=\"/en/card/01090\">Tollbooth</a> both have abilities that fire on \"encountering\" the ICE. <a href=\"/en/card/01090\">Tollbooth</a> has a single subroutine, which means <a href=\"/en/card/01026\">Femme Fatale</a> only has to spend 1 credit to Bypass this piece of ICE. If two things happen for both players at the same time, the active player gets to do all their actions first, and then the inactive player does theirs. In this case <a href=\"/en/card/01026\">Femme Fatale</a> encounters <a href=\"/en/card/01090\">Tollbooth</a>, pays the 1 to Bypass <a href=\"/en/card/01090\">Tollbooth</a>, and now because we are no longer encountering <a href=\"/en/card/01090\">Tollbooth</a>, the ICE cannot interact with the player, and thus cannot force them to lose the 3 credits.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use <a href=\"/en/card/01048\">Sacrificial Construct</a> to save a <a href=\"/en/card/01051\">Crypsis</a></strong></p>\n\n<p>Run into a <a href=\"/en/card/01076\">Data Mine</a> while you have <a href=\"/en/card/01051\">Crypsis</a> out? Instead of taking the 1 Net Damage, break the Trap subroutine with <a href=\"/en/card/01051\">Crypsis</a>, and instead of trashing <a href=\"/en/card/01051\">Crypsis</a>, prevent this trashing by trashing your <a href=\"/en/card/01048\">Sacrificial Construct</a>!</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>Start with Basic Deck Building process by combining all HB (27 cards) with all Neutral (21 cards). This is a good start, I'm only missing 1 to make it 49 cards and the minimum for this ID is 45 cards. Let's get to it step-by-step:</p>\n\n<p>[1] Agenda Density. The deck at 49 cards requires 20-21 agenda points. It is always best to go max cards at the minimum points to reduce the likelihood of drawing agendas.\nI have a total of (10) agenda cards at 21 points. I will remove <a href=\"/en/card/02080\">False Lead</a>.</p>\n\n<p>[2] Decent Spread of ICE. Generally about 15-18 cards in total. Since the ID is about bioroid ICE, all of them are auto-includes to maximize ID's advantage. I have a total of (6) Sentries, (4) Barriers and (7) Code Gates.</p>\n\n<p>[3] Economic Engine. Generally 9-12 cards in total. In fact, I have 14 in total.</p>\n\n<p>[4] Use Influence. This ID comes with up to 15 to spend. Use influence to import tricks to confuse and surprise the Runner or to shore up weaknesses in the deck. Here's my thought process for this starter deck.<br />\n- added <a href=\"/en/card/01070\">Snare!</a> just to throw off the Runner's tempo.<br />\n- added <a href=\"/en/card/02019\">Caduceus</a>, it has ETR and could trigger creds which are important for HB as their ICEs are not generally cheap.<br />\n- added <a href=\"/en/card/01103\">Ice Wall</a> and <a href=\"/en/card/04117\">Hive</a> for ETR as well as to smooth the cost curve for Barrier ICEs.<br />\n- added <a href=\"/en/card/01090\">Tollbooth</a> for ETR and to snipe the Runner's bank.<br />\n- added <a href=\"/en/card/01098\">Beanstalk Royalties</a> just to boost income generation which is never bad.</p>\n\n<p>[5] Cutting Cards. We have far more than needed to reach 49 cards in total.<br />\n- removed <a href=\"/en/card/01112\">Hunter</a> as the tag wouldn't synergize as much as an NBN deck will.<br />\n- removed <a href=\"/en/card/01111\">Enigma</a> because there is excess Code Gate ICEs.<br />\n- removed <a href=\"/en/card/01108\">Melange Mining Corp.</a>, too many assets to guard.<br />\n- removed <a href=\"/en/card/01057\">Aggressive Secretary</a> since I've added <a href=\"/en/card/01070\">Snare!</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Every card should be readily understood, and there should be a minimum of rules clarifications necessary. Enjoy!</p>\n",

I used only one core set and each of the deluxe expansions to make at least one decklist for every ID available in the Core Set and each deluxe. Obviously a handful of the IDs do not have the support to shine in this limited cardpool, but I tried my best. These decklists exist in a bubble, so \u201cMeta\u201d picks are hard to judge (Sharon Claire and/or Cyberdex Virus Suite vs. Noise, Damage protection for runners), so that\u2019s pretty much for you to decide. For anyone questioning how much fun you can get out of 1 Core and 4 Deluxes, I hope they can have as much fun with these lists as I did making them.</p>\n",

Knowing who's who and who's where is right up NBN's alley, letting them spend <span class=\"icon icon-credit\"></span>s to conveniently get those darned connections in jail and locations under surveillance.</p>\n\n<p>To help with that we have the beautiful <a href=\"/en/card/02097\">Bernice Mai</a> to punish any Runner thinking about stealing our precious agendas. Speaking of agendas, noone can resist the lure of sweet, sweet <a href=\"/en/card/04075\">Bitcoin</a>, and once they get their sticky fingers on that, we have 'em. You can protect it with <a href=\"/en/card/01088\">Data Raven</a>, all but guaranteeing one tag, and maybe getting another one too. <a href=\"/en/card/01087\">Ghost Branch</a> can potentially give the Runner more tags than they can deal with, and <a href=\"/en/card/01070\">Snare!</a> can tag the Runner from (almost) anywhere. If none of those work, maybe a <a href=\"/en/card/01086\">SEA Source</a> can get you the info you need.</p>\n\n<p>Once you get those tags, you gotta put 'em to use. Trashing resources is fine, but few things can be as crippling as a <a href=\"/en/card/01084\">Closed Accounts</a>. If they stop bothering to remove tags (On account of having so many), <a href=\"/en/card/01085\">Psychographics</a> can score cards out of nowhere. Furthermore, a <a href=\"/en/card/02118\">Dedicated Response Team</a> and <a href=\"/en/card/01107\">Private Security Force</a> can be hired once you know where the Runner's hiding.</p>\n\n<p>You may have noticed that a lot of these cards have <strong>trace</strong>. This can help tax the Runner, and with 2<span class=\"icon icon-recurring-credit\"></span> coming from your ID, odds are when you <em>really</em> want that trace to stick, it will. Of course, given that the Runner <em>can</em> pay their way out of traces, it's not exactly foolproof, buuuuut... It's all in an effort to run them into the ground, right?</p>\n\n<p>Oh, and <a href=\"/en/card/01090\">Tollbooth</a> is in your faction. </p>\n\n<p><em>Made with one Revised Core Set</em></p>\n",

Logos is used as I'm 1x Core and want to hit my console more reliably, so I can hit my console more often than if I used Desperado. The extra hand space is often meaningful because we often like to hold our situational cards (Stimhacks, Femme, etc) and because we're using Stimhacks. The tutor is useful because Ken struggles to play from behind, so any time the corp scores we'll be retrieving an answer to the board and continue to pursue our aggressive gameplan. This deck is fairly hard to evaluate from the board, and while we focus on Centrals, we have options to get into scoring remotes even when it looks like we're not able to.</p>\n",

The recommended starter decks in the core set aren\u2019t very efficient nor do they use any influence, so I have worked with some friends to design a few starter decks. Every starter deck is made of a single core set and we have also made variants with no 1-of cards so anyone with 3 core-sets can throw together these starter decks and have them lying around to introduce new players. We have tested the Beginner decks against each other and the Intermediate decks against each other and they are pretty balance with the runner winning slightly more often.</p>\n\n<p>Beginner decks are designed for players just picking up the game. They are straight forward and have very little tricks.</p>\n\n<p>Intermediate decks introduce players to more complex and interesting concepts such as search, traps, and viruses.</p>\n\n<p>Advanced decks are your own decks that you design and build. Get familiar with the other factions and cards. Experiment and have fun!</p>\n\n<p>The goal for this deck was to make a fortress deck with very little tricks. Weyland seemed like a good choice as they have very strong burst economy and strong ICE with Hadrian\u2019s Wall and Archer. Splashed in Tollbooth for a strong Code Gate, Rototurrets for extra trashing, and Adonis Campaign for more money. Get money, play ICE, advance agendas. Simple and effective.</p>\n\n<p>This deck contains no 1-ofs.</p>\n",

Note how only 2 cards in the entire deck cost 4 or more (excl. Hedge Fund). Almost every ICE in my suite has a 2 credit swing (excluding Swordsman and vs. Morning Star) while costing me next-to-nothing. A fast tempo deck that makes Shapers desperately search for their Test Runs, Criminals desperately search for their Special Orders, and Anarchs cry into their pillows.</p>\n\n<p>Weaknesses include late-game vulnerability - Ichi 1.0 and Tollbooth can both be taken care of if needed and Femme Fatale can really make either cry. I really dislike the agenda suite as well - hate having those 2 PriReq and even the PSF does not hold its weight. Future improvements would be adding more econ and a bit heftier ICE just to deal with runners who can match the tempo.</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>I played this deck at a beginners' tournament in London, along with my Argus deck. The deck-building restriction was a single core set and single deluxe box of each player's choice, so I plumped for Order &amp; Chaos. With Argus, I had gone for basically a core-set Weyland build with only minor changes. Looking at Order &amp; Chaos with my orange goggles on, I wondered if I could make an ID that wasn't Noise work. This was what I came up with. </p>\n\n<p>I've played a bit of MaxX, and without <a href=\"/en/card/03038\">Clone Chip</a> &amp; <a href=\"/en/card/03035\">Levy AR Lab Access</a>, let alone <a href=\"/en/card/03054\">Same Old Thing</a>, I figured getting 13 cards and watching the rest end up in the heap was a no-go. I toyed with the idea of Edward Kim, particularly because there is so little recursion available for corporations if you're only building with one deluxe and one core set (Archived Memories, anyone?). But then I thought about what I was good at as a runner and a Valencia idea started to form. No <a href=\"/en/card/04089\">Blackmail</a>, so what are my other options?</p>\n\n<p>I love the fixed-strength breakers from core-set Anarch, and I feel I've had a fair bit of experience getting that sort of rig, plus <a href=\"/en/card/01008\">Datasucker</a>, <a href=\"/en/card/01012\">Parasite</a> and <a href=\"/en/card/01010\">Medium</a>, up and running. So that became a skeleton for the deck, with the addition of <a href=\"/en/card/07036\">Day Job</a>, <a href=\"/en/card/01050\">Sure Gamble</a> and <a href=\"/en/card/01053\">Armitage Codebusting</a> for economy. I've Had Worse was a no-brainer, and I plumped for <a href=\"/en/card/01034\">Diesel</a> too, so I had 6 cards in the deck that I could turn into 18 (I think that's a bit of a bogus way of thinking of it, but hey, it made me feel comfortable with the deck size). I added two <a href=\"/en/card/01022\">Special Order</a>, too, because tutoring is a cool thing, right? (I should note at this point: not including <a href=\"/en/card/01016\">Wyldside</a> was a deliberate choice. I felt like it was anti-synergistic with running often to make the most of the bad publicity. It worked out for me on the day. A sample turn might be draw, hit R&amp;D, hit HQ, credit. There were also turns when the corp dipped to safe low-levels of cash and I would go rampant killing Adonis campaigns, PADs and other things. I liked those four clicks!)</p>\n\n<p>Then I started looking for synergistic combinations that might work. In went <a href=\"/en/card/07031\">Amped Up</a> and <a href=\"/en/card/07035\">Wanton Destruction</a> as a pair, and then <a href=\"/en/card/07047\">Vigil</a>, <a href=\"/en/card/07049\">Investigative Journalism</a> and <a href=\"/en/card/07033\">Itinerant Protesters</a>. I have to say, I loved the squeeze that that trio could put on a corp, particularly if I'd taken a turn to get the bad publicity to two. Their handsize is 3, I'm drawing if they stay at that size, and it also makes playing <a href=\"/en/card/07035\">Wanton Destruction</a> all that much easier. I know, I know, playing <a href=\"/en/card/07035\">Wanton</a> turns off <a href=\"/en/card/07047\">Vigil</a>.... but it didn't seem to matter. </p>\n\n<p>On the day, we played 4 rounds of swiss, and the deck went 4-0. I played against three Titan decks and one core-set HB. Game one came down to a late-game <a href=\"/en/card/01010\">Medium</a>. He had 5 points and a double-advanced card behind a hefty three-ice deep defence, and I had 6 points. I got in, saw two cards with Medium, and clinched a 1-pointer to win. Against HB, it was all about economy: I ran and ran (thank you, bad publicity, for incentivising so) and trashed any econ he brought up. He managed to get some points out but I had the board-lead and the muscle to carry on. </p>\n\n<p>My final two Titan opponents both played with the constellation ice and were looking to get a train of Firmware Updates going. Money was crucial here, as were <a href=\"/en/card/01008\">Datasucker</a> (ugh those big constellation ice sap your tokens) and restricting their options with the aforementioned Vigil-InvestigativeJournalism-ItinerantProtesters plays. When they only have two cards in hand (thank you Hostile Takeover for adding to the bad publicity pool), which are both agendas, they won't rez ice on R&amp;D because their HQ is so vital. Cue star of the day, <a href=\"/en/card/01010\">Medium</a>, and nod to <a href=\"/en/card/01020\">Forged Activation Orders</a> doing great work. Likewise with constellation ice: once that first advancement lands, if the corp doesn't have 6 credits in store, they are prime targets. </p>\n\n<p>Things that didn't really work: <a href=\"/en/card/07048\">Human First</a> was great playing online but I never saw it. I never played the <a href=\"/en/card/07031\">Amped Up</a> + <a href=\"/en/card/07035\">Wanton</a> combo, really. <a href=\"/en/card/07034\">Showing Off</a> was there as a joke include and I drew into it first game, binned it, and smiled, saying something about how I was that kind of bonkers player (I'm not). It seemed to give me an edge though. #disgustinghipstermoi If you have any suggestions about what might have filled some of those slots (maybe the cutlery events?), please let me know! </p>\n\n<p>Thanks again to my excellent opponents, to Dark Sphere and to Tagore for organising. Ps not sure if this should be tagged as placing highly in a GNK but I've done it and you can shout me down!</p>\n",

Behind the big city lights and down a dark and unused alleyway, a light flickered from one of broken and ran down buildings.   </p>\n\n<p>Inside the building a guy was working in his own accord. Tapping away at the keyboard at a rate of knots and then all a sudden stop and to search for a pencil to write something down only for the next minute to scrunch it up and through away. Then leaning back against his chair he would swing for awhile and grab some previous scrunched up paper and start typing again.  </p>\n\n<p>Exile, as he is known in the Shapers society. No one knows why but maybe his passion for freelance coding and armitage code busting, has left him with no time for inter personal skills. Or as some say his mind is too busy with codes.  </p>\n\n<p>He is a talent as many of his friends, (the term friends used loosely, more contact and associates) has quoted time and again but an enigma at the same time. Many has tried to get him an interview with the big Corporations but all has failed with the same ending.  </p>\n\n<p>\"Son, your codes are useless junk, scavenged from past master \u2013 has been, nothing useful to us, you might be consider a street-hawk \"tech whiz\" on the streets but we have many here. You need to up your game\". </p>\n\n<p>Incident Report: </p>\n\n<p>Incident 1: Chronos Protocol (Lose 6-7) \nThis started well, hitting an early Professional Contact, and totally confusing the Corp with scavenge Femme from one to another previously unbreakable ice, swinging the momentum in  Exile favor 6-3; only to be halted by the Corp with the lack available agenda. 4x Maker's eye reveal nothing but traps. His Ark Lockdown proved to be an Achilles heel, and then the game turned when I was spotted by Marcus Batty and in attempt to get away dropped the agenda and programs to be locked out of the remote server. Lady luck was not with Exile, lost all but 1 psi game.  </p>\n\n<p>Incident 2: Harishchandra Ent (Win 8-3) \nFeeling bruised but not battered after the last Jinteki encounter, Exile decide to go for a more public approach. Breakers had little trouble with any ice. Went 5-1 up only to hit a couple of news team but knew it wasn't a problem as had data dealer somewhere in my stack. It only meant a matter of time.  </p>\n\n<p>Incident 3: Replicating Perfection (Win 7-1) \nWith his ego restored, Exile was back for another Jinteki test. This time much easier running at time with no breakers was criminal. Jinteki bluff at it's worst, in between walking into HQ 4 times, whilst security was low yielded and a single remote run, this was the easiest and fastest pay day. Agenda's Exiled.  </p>\n\n<p>Concluding thought: </p>\n\n<p>The Creation and Control was definitely a bonus and a much needed addition for the Shapers from the Core set . I have always found Kate in Core only too slow to setup and hence lose too much momentum and was always relying on a bit of lucky on memory count.  If I was to be completely honest this deck though was thoroughly enjoyable and the look on people faces when it wins, can easily be ran with any other Shaper ID and be much more efficient even the Professor. The shift in meta with flashpoint cycle does add some interesting counters but that is both ways and with lots of spare influence can easily add in a combination of rumor mill/paperclip/beth etc.</p>\n",

That, and extra <span class=\"icon icon-mu\"></span> for all our viruses is always welcome.</p>\n\n<p>A few ways to make money, a few ways to break the corp's stuff, your fixed strength breakers will either wow you with their efficiency, or make you cry tears saltier than the world's oceans because you didn't draw your <a href=\"/en/card/01008\">Datasucker</a>s.</p>\n\n<p>Seriously though, with Imp and Demolition run and two scrubbers, you can make life extremely difficult. <a href=\"/en/card/04082\">Hemorrhage</a> seems like an amazing card, and my only regret is that I only have one of them. Oh well. </p>\n\n<p>2<span class=\"icon icon-credit\"></span> ice tax, anyone? Thanks, <a href=\"/en/card/02082\">Xanadu</a>. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/en/card/01015\">Ice Carver</a> is a card that I thought was kinda crummy at first, but 1) It works with your fixed ice breakers, which is nice, and 2) It makes your runs with <a href=\"/en/card/02062\">Force of Nature</a> cheaper. What I thought at first was a crummy card to mess with your opponent is actually a really strong economy card that under lots of situations can make your runs 1-2<span class=\"icon icon-credit\"></span> cheaper <em>for each ice you encounter.</em>  Maybe now I'm over-valuing it, but man oh man, always be running, right?</p>\n\n<p>Also important to remember is that <a href=\"/en/card/02002\">Spinal Modem</a> only gives you brain damage if you've been tagged <em>during a run.</em> So if you can break those nasty subroutines before they fire, you're in a good spot. And if you can't... Well... Hope you've emptied a <a href=\"/en/card/02022\">Liberated Account</a> the turn before. (Even then, one brain damage isn't the end of the game.)</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>EDIT:</em></strong> I'd personally add 1 <a href=\"/en/card/01026\">Femme Fatale</a>, and replace either a <a href=\"/en/card/01011\">Mimic</a> (So that we're running 3 killers) or <a href=\"/en/card/02004\">Morning Star</a> (So we're playing less high-cost ice.).

    "description": "<p>This was my runner deck for @FightingWalloon's teaching league at the end of 2017. It did reasonably well at the start but faded in the latter half of the tournament.</p>\n\n<p>Key point is to run a little more aggressively against the corp (except Jinteki - at least get Mimic ready). The additional credit rez cost will afford you a few accesses outside of an Ice Wall. Xanadu will make the corp ice rezzes even more painful.</p>\n\n<p>Influence was used on Diesel for card draw and Special Order for finding breakers at the right time. Dinosaurus to help with the fixed strength breakers. I personally preferred Mimic since that will bash Archer for 4 credits if combined with Ice Carver but that means Morning Star can't break Hadrian's Wall without Datasucker support.</p>\n\n<p>With one link, you only need to install a single Dyson Mem Chip to activate Underworld Contact for a permanent econ boost. Armitage Codebusting is great if you're broke but don't lean on it too much as it is extremely slow to pay out.</p>\n\n<p>Retrieval Run can be useful for installing Morning Star without paying the eye-watering cost but just dumping it into the heap at the end of your turn may prompt the corp to plant an ice wall on Archives to stop you. Great for restoring an icebreaker that gets trashed though.</p>\n\n<p>Also yes, that's a lone Easy Mark. I had 1 influence spare and more money is good I guess?</p>\n\n<p>Out of my 2 decks, I believe this is the weaker of the 2. Maybe swap Crypsis for Darwin as Darwin is less of a tempo hit.</p>\n\n<p>I hope this will prove useful for newer players!</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>This is the final version of the corp deck I used during most of the Stimhack Triple Core tournament that ran from Dec 2017 to Feb 2018.  This was a revised core only tournament and I ended in the middle of the pack after Swiss.  It's certainly not the best deck in the world, but I feel like it did alright considering I just got into netrunner a couple weeks before the start of the tournament.</p>\n\n<p>The deck is meant to be a straight up kill focused deck, but I scored out almost as often as flatlined on wins with the deck.  I often had problems getting good use out of <a href=\"/en/card/02118\">Dedicated Response Team</a> so it was slowly phased out, and might be something I would replace altogether if I was going to modify the deck again.</p>\n\n<p>The traps in the deck are definitely the most interesting part and can be a very valuable surprise.  The <a href=\"/en/card/20098\">Snare!</a> tended to be expected unless they could be baited into believing it was a naked asset and they were trash happy, but throwing out <a href=\"/en/card/01069\">Project Junebug</a> or <a href=\"/en/card/20065\">Aggressive Secretary</a> if the runner hadn't seen traps in the deck yet was often very surprising.  And once the advanceable traps are known the runner tends to be a bit more wary of just running anything you've advanced at all costs, usually opening things up for an easy <a href=\"/en/card/20083\">GRNDL Refinery</a> or agenda.</p>\n\n<p>If I were going to continue to play this deck one of the other refinements I would make is dumping the final <a href=\"/en/card/04117\">Hive</a> in the deck.  Despite it's usefulness early game and the deck's focus on killing versus scoring I found it was rarely helping all that much, and would come up late too often even back when I ran three in the first iteration of the deck.</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>Just like everyone else, I started learning to play A:NR with Jinteki Vs. Kate (as the rulebook suggests). I played too many games as corp only with a single runner friend (playing Kate of course) and I always felt so poor. Not many ways to make <span class=\"icon icon-credit\"></span>credits other than <span class=\"icon icon-click\"></span>clicking for it or <a href=\"/en/card/01110\">Hedge Fund</a> if I'm lucky enough, while on the other side there was a juicy <a href=\"en/card/01044\">Magnum Opus</a> for up to 8cr per turn. Frustrated as I was, I started researching for my first deckbuilding. Rules were simple enough regarding Agendas and Influence, but I still couldn't make my core <a href=\"en/card/01067\">Jinteki</a> deck rich enough. How can I protect myself if I can't pay 4<span class=\"icon icon-credit\"></span> for a <a href=\"/en/card/01070\">Snare!</a> or advance a <a href=\"/en/card/01069\">Project Junebug</a>? I figured Jinteki mindgames are not for beginners and went exploring other factions. The glacier approach seems like the safest most reliable route, build an ICE fort and advance. <a href=\"/en/card/01054\">HB</a> became my favorite, followed by <a href=\"/en/card/01093\">Weyland</a>. <a href=\"/en/card/01080\">NBN</a> feels very awkward, no traps for shell game, no money for big forts...lots of tags and little punishment....my mind couldn't even comprehend why would anybody play that ID out of the box.</p>\n\n<p>It's the poorest corp with seemingly the worst ice aside <a href=\"/en/card/01090\">Tollbooth</a>...and TB is too expensive for NBN to be able to rez. With so little ETR (end the run) ice, the runner roams free wherever he pleases. NBN seems to be a master of tagging but has little ways to punish the runner for it. How would you feel about <a href=\"/en/card/01099\">burning their house down</a>?</p>\n\n<p>There are 2x <a href=\"/en/card/01099\">Scorched Earth</a> and 2x <a href=\"/en/card/01058\">Archived Memories</a> to recur it if needed. Runner must learn to respect tags. If the runner is careful enough to clear tags, <a href=\"/en/card/01086\">SEA Source</a> will be of aid. </p>\n\n<p>Main goal of this deck: flatline by <a href=\"/en/card/01099\">Scorch</a> and a bit of economy is needed to land the kill.

    "description": "<p>I entered this into a beginners tournament which restricted us to one Core and one Deluxe.</p>\n\n<p>Three ideas lead me to this deck.\nThe first was a strong economy. Professional contacts, Magnum Opus, Bank job and lastly Aesop's Pawnshop, the last I nearly took out but gladly didn't as i really help in my first game.</p>\n\n<p>The second was Code Gate's and how to get around everything else. The Gordian Blade is really strong early game but i didn't want to spend influence on ice breakers. I settled on Atman for stronger Ice and Crypsis on the weaker. I hadn't thought about how Wayland could strengthen some of their ice but Atman was still great for Data Raven's and Tollbooths, Crypsis along with tinkering did for the rest.</p>\n\n<p>The third was fear. Most of the protections from damage was gone and scorched earth was a big fear for me as was brain damage. So I protected myself with Decoy's and Used Satellite's to avoid danger, the latter also being able to undo brain damages effects. I later found that the Decoy's were a great call as it held back a lot of SEA Source and Posted Bounties from killing me early in games, as i heard happened a few times.</p>\n\n<p>I managed to win three of three of my games using this deck bringing me second overall. I feel I got lucky in all of them as I would panic towards the end as it got close and managed to pull it of. The first game we were both at six agenda's each and i made a run at HQ and pulled one out of five. The second I think I had four to their five and Maker's Eye'd R&amp;D for two two pointer's. And the last game was against my rival from my local meet up and I knew a few tells which really helped.</p>\n\n<p>A great tournament and it was a pleasure to meet everyone</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>A:NR rule-book suggests that beginner runners should start with <a href=\"/en/card/01033\">Kate</a>. After a lot of deck-building within the core set, I experimented with all 3 IDs. <a href=\"/en/card/01017\">Gabriel</a> became my favorite after I included a <a href=\"/en/card/01043\">Gordian Blade</a>] in his deck. <a href=\"/en/card/01001\">Noise</a> is also good in a chaotic way, but kind of weak in the core set. I feel that Shaper is more powerful (core set only) because of her ability and general economy. I built this rig to help beginners with Shaper strategy that's not running necessarily every turn, but once the deck is built she's very dangerous.</p>\n\n<h1>Hardware + Icebreakers</h1>\n\n<ul><li>1x <a href=\"/en/card/01007\">Corroder</a> (Barriers)</li>\n<li>1x <a href=\"/en/card/01027\">Ninja</a> (Sentries)</li>\n<li>3x <a href=\"/en/card/01043\">Gordian Blades</a> (Code gates)</li>\n<li>1x <a href=\"/en/card/01051\">Crypsis</a> (AI)</li>\n</ul><p>The reason I included 1-off icebreakers is to conserve deck space and influence. 3 copies of <a href=\"/en/card/01043\">Gordian Blade</a> are plenty to find it in deck. <a href=\"/en/card/01022\">Special Orders</a> and #Diesel will help find the rest. <a href=\"/en/card/01037\">Tinkering</a> will also be of aid early and mid game if the rig is not complete yet. Use <a href=\"/en/card/01040\">The Personal Touch</a> for <a href=\"/en/card/01007\">Corroder</a> or <a href=\"/en/card/01043\">Gordian Blade</a>...or even <a href=\"/en/card/01051\">Crypsis</a>.

I included <a href=\"/en/card/01041\">The Toolbox</a> and <a href=\"/en/card/01024\">Desperado</a>, install whichever comes first. They both provide good economy, but I'd rather install <a href=\"/en/card/01041\">Toolbox</a> with the aid of <a href=\"/en/card/01035\">Modded</a> and <a href=\"/en/card/01033\">Kate's</a> ability. <a href=\"/en/card/01006\">Grimoire</a> is an amazing console but useless to this deck aside the <span class=\"icon icon-2mu\"></span>.</p>\n\n<h1>Economy &amp; card draw</h1>\n\n<ul><li>3x <a href=\"/en/card/01050\">Sure Gamble</a> - burst 12<span class=\"icon icon-credit\"></span></li>\n<li>2x <a href=\"/en/card/01035\">Modded</a> - 6<span class=\"icon icon-credit\"></span> discount!

It focuses on early pressure and getting into remotes using Inside Job. Also, Crash Space saved my life in one game. It's the only meat damage prevention in Core 2.0 and with all the Punitive Counterstrike going on it's a must include.</p>\n\n<p>This deck is really fun to play as it feels like old criminal.

Despite people, myself included, lamenting some of the choices for the Revised Core, it felt like a pretty solid experience.</p>\n\n<p>As for the deck, you don't get much choice on the in-faction cards so I'll focus on the imports. As much R&amp;D pressure as I could muster. I would have picked event-based R&amp;D pressure over RDIs event if I had the choice, given how expensive running is in this format. Indexing was the MVP, getting me a lot of my wins. I then chose economy over upgrading the breakers. A lot of people brought in Gordian, but I figured I could put up with 2 credits per sub with a little extra cash. Datasucker never really payed out on the day of.</p>\n\n<p>Beat an HB, a Weyland, and a Jinteki decks. My only loss of the day was to another PE deck when I lost my first set of breakers to an AggSec, Indexing wiffed and I made the wrong call in trap-or-no-trap too many times.</p>\n\n<p>Anyways, the event was a ton of fun and I definitely recommend you give it a go if you have the chance.</p>\n",

With 3 x I've had worse, 3 x Diesel, 2 x Deja Vu &amp; Same Old and a single Levy AR Lab Access, you can afford to discard the majority of your cards until you have exactly what you want, and then reboot the entire thing with Levy.</p>\n\n<p>Key combos:\nYou want to host your Hiveminds on Progenitor, to protect them from purges. Once you have all 3 up and running, your Mediums and Parasites will always have 3 counters on it regardless of purges, allowing for cheap and easy Biter Cutlery runs on the corporations ice.</p>\n\n<p>Use Biter to force the corp to rez their ice, then use or the cutlery events (Spoon/Knife/Fork) to remove the ice protecting the server.</p>\n\n<p>Use Djinn to get your virus' cards in play as fast as possible, and move counters to Hivemind with Virus Breeding Ground.</p>\n\n<p>Technical Writer is your bank, Magnum Opus for when you need those extra credit and Daily Cast as a decent passive income.</p>\n\n<p>You can use Same Old Thing and Deja Vu to return spent virus programs and events, and Levy Access to reshuffle your heap and grip into your stack, as you will be discarding most of it initially to get the combo cards as fast as possible.</p>\n\n<p>This will allow you to break up to 8 type-specific Ice, and at minimum 6 type-specific ices if your game drags on, and to re-use Daily Cast once they've been bled dry.</p>\n",

I used only one core set and each of the deluxe expansions to make at least one decklist for every ID available in the Core Set and each deluxe. Obviously a handful of the IDs do not have the support to shine in this limited cardpool, but I tried my best. These decklists exist in a bubble, so \u201cMeta\u201d picks are hard to judge (Sharon Claire and/or Cyberdex Virus Suite vs. Noise, Damage protection for runners), so that\u2019s pretty much for you to decide. For anyone questioning how much fun you can get out of 1 Core and 4 Deluxes, I hope they can have as much fun with these lists as I did making them.</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>Right, so, a few things about piloting this. I'd say a few intricacies, but I'm not good enough to use that term yet.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/en/card/02033\">Trick of Light</a> can move advancement counters from your advanceable ice to agendas. You have two. That means with a bit of planning you can play and then score <a href=\"/en/card/01107\">Private Security Force</a> or <a href=\"/en/card/02018\">Project Atlas</a> on the same turn. Use it to either close out a game, or threaten to.</p>\n\n<p>Speaking of <a href=\"/en/card/01107\">Private Security Force</a>, it and <a href=\"/en/card/02118\">Dedicated Response Team</a> like it when the runner is tagged. Sadly, you're weyland, you don't deal with knowing where people are. Well, <a href=\"/en/card/01112\">Hunter</a> can have a wee sniff around for you, and <a href=\"/en/card/01070\">Snare!</a> can make the runner scared of running anywhere for fear of the damage AND the tag. Punish those last click runs, and ruin some rigs. Oh, turns out <a href=\"/en/card/01104\">Shadow</a> can tag too. Brilliant.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/en/card/02070\">Green Level Clearance</a> is a transaction. It's a beanstalk with draw. It might be decent. I don't know, I play runner. Sue me, you know you want to.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/en/card/04079\">Punitive Counterstrike</a> is great for punishing big swing turns. Or even just turns where that basement gremlin stole your <a href=\"/en/card/01106\">Priority Requisition</a> or <a href=\"/en/card/04036\">The Cleaners</a>. Ruin their day for threatening to ruin your bottom line, Trace 5 is either going to cripple their bank account or their legs. Either way, is good day (If you're a multi-trillion credit megacorp with more power and influence than some countries (Looking at you, Belgium.))</p>\n\n<p>Overall, it might be an ok deck. There's not a whole lot of big ice, but hey, the fact that you only run four code gates is bound to upset those damned self-absorbed Shapers. Thinking they're so good they can get two <span class=\"icon icon-credit\"></span> per <span class=\"icon icon-click\"></span> , <strong><em>get a job.</em></strong> Ice your centrals, get money, win. Not hard. He says. Not playing corporation. You got this. Unless I'm playing against you. In which case I hope the top card of R&amp;D is <em>always</em> an agenda.</p>\n\n<p><em>Built with only one Revised Core Set</em></p>\n",

These decklists exist in a bubble, so \u201cMeta\u201d picks are hard to judge (Sharon Claire and/or Cyberdex Virus Suite vs. Noise, Damage protection for runners), so that\u2019s pretty much for you to decide.

But, there are still plenty of tricks and interesting card interactions that can be revealed to the new player.</p>\n\n<p>Firstly, <a href=\"/en/card/02064\">Doppelg\u00e4nger</a> shows some fun interactions with it, Datasucker, Pheromones, and Notoriety. And to make economy more interesting, I included <a href=\"/en/card/01047\">Aesop's Pawnshop</a> to be used with <a href=\"/en/card/01053\">Armitage Codebusting</a>, <a href=\"/en/card/01029\">Bank Job</a>, and programs they no longer feel are useful. Granted, some of these interactions are more complicated, but when player's discover these things, or are taught the unique abilities when combining the cards, hopefully, the game will grab there interest.</p>\n\n<p>There are of course some basic filler and utility cards, as this is from a single Core Set and it is also a good idea to show the potential of cards and effect in the game. Hopefully, I'll have a chance to try this out soon and see how it goes.</p>\n",

Jinteki is already going to be spread thin on its ICE. <a href=\"/en/card/01074\">Cell Portal</a> could be a good endgame card, I guess, but since it's so position-dependant and expensive, I don't think a new player would like it. It could work, though. <a href=\"/en/card/01112\">Hunter</a> had no synergy at all. </p>\n\n<p>Possible changes include adding the Beanstalk Royalties from Weyland, for even more money. </p>\n\n<p>Note that the ice is not particularly strong or good at stopping runs. You will eventually lose assets (this is a notable problem in my testing). Score quickly, and assume that the runner will break your ice. Then hit them with the traps, and score while they're recovering.</p>\n",

This is a good start, I'm only missing 1 to make it 49 cards and the minimum for this ID is 45 cards. Let's get to it step-by-step:</p>\n\n<p>[1] Agenda Density. The deck at 49 cards requires 20-21 agenda points. It is always best to go max cards at the minimum points to reduce the likelihood of drawing agendas. I have a total of (10) agenda cards at 21 points. I will remove <a href=\"/en/card/02080\">False Lead</a>.</p>\n\n<p>[2] Decent Spread of ICE. Generally about 15-18 cards in total. Since the ID is about bioroid ICE, all of them are auto-includes to maximize ID's advantage. I have a total of (5) Sentries, (5) Barriers and (8) Code Gates.</p>\n\n<p>[3] Economic Engine. Generally 9-12 cards in total. In fact, I have 14 in total.</p>\n\n<p>[4] Use Influence. This ID comes with up to 15 to spend. Use influence to import tricks to confuse and surprise the Runner or to shore up weaknesses in the deck. Here's my thought process for this faction teaching deck.<br />\n- added <a href=\"/en/card/01070\">Snare!</a>, <a href=\"/en/card/01078\">Wall of Thorns</a> and <a href=\"/en/card/01077\">Neural Katana</a> just to throw off the Runner's tempo.<br />\n- added <a href=\"/en/card/01090\">Tollbooth</a> for ETR and to snipe the Runner's bank.<br />\n- added <a href=\"/en/card/04012\">Celebrity Gift</a> just to boost income generation which is never bad.  </p>\n\n<p>[5] Cutting Cards. We have far more than needed to reach 49 cards in total.<br />\n- removed <a href=\"/en/card/01112\">Hunter</a> as the tag wouldn't synergize as much as an NBN deck will.<br />\n- removed <a href=\"/en/card/01108\">Melange Mining Corp.</a>, too many assets to guard.<br />\n- removed <a href=\"/en/card/01057\">Aggressive Secretary</a> since I've added <a href=\"/en/card/01070\">Snare!</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>Every card should be readily understood, and there should be a minimum of rules clarifications necessary.

    "description": "<p>I created this deck for a beginner's competition at Dark Sphere in London that required decks made from 1 core + 1 deluxe expansion. </p>\n\n<p>The ultimate strategy is to get everything iced up and use Tennin to advance agendas quickly, hopefully getting a free cred from NeoTokyo Grid. If the ice doesn't come out your way then focus on getting a single strong remote server iced up and try to advance the 2 point agendas through quickly and hope the Psi-games go your way with FP (pro-tip - always bet 2 if you can, runners are cheap-skates!)</p>\n\n<p>Scoring a PR is a great way to get that scary-looking Susanoo out, and a dream move is to Susanoo someone into an ice with komainu or a neural katana waiting for them.</p>\n\n<p>Money can be a problem with this deck, but building some solid ice and pumping a melange can definitely give you what you need to pay for all the big ice. </p>\n\n<p>The zaibatsu is just a left-over from pre-empting a lot of infiltration at the beginners tournament, though that didn't really happen. I've left it in there as a junky card that can trick a runner into running on a heavily iced server just to find the zaibatsu. </p>\n\n<p>Talking about tricks, I adore Mushin No Shin. Getting a Mushin, an agenda and an ice-wall or wall of static in the first turn is always great as it almost guarantees you a score. Another use is to use it to stick an agenda, junebug or aggressive secretary out unprotected and dare the runner to come at it. I'm not sure if the junebug and AS are even necessary for the deck or whether the threat of them is enough!</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I'm sure there's a few places the deck could be tweaked and optimised, but I find that it actually performs pretty damn well on OCTGN against all the new cards and I find it super fun to play, as I never know how I'm going to play until I get my opening hand. I've had games with 4 or 5 remote servers up with 1 agenda among snares and junk. I love Jinteki and I love this deck - I hope someone else likes it too!</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>This is the Weyland deck I played in round 1 of FightingWalloon's S3C (Stimhack 3-Core) teaching tournament. Decks are built from 3 copies of the Revised Core Set, and players can change IDs/decks throughout the tournament. I wanted to play each faction over the course of the tournament.</p>\n\n<p>In the revised core, fracters are not great. <a href=\"/en/card/20048\">Battering Ram</a> and <a href=\"/en/card/20014\">Morning Star</a> are the two best options. Without support, Morning Star can't deal with <a href=\"/en/card/20086\">Hadrian's Wall</a> or an advanced <a href=\"/en/card/20088\">Ice Wall</a>. Battering Ram is less binary, but still a big tempo hit for the runner to install (and is easier to tax out at minimum 2<span class=\"icon icon-credit\"></span> per ICE). </p>\n\n<p>This deck simply aims to rush behind cheap ETR ICE in the early game and lock the runner out in the late game with high-strength barriers. While BABW has the best econ in the revised core, I found in a few test games that I was rarely able to afford <a href=\"/en/card/20075\">Ash 2X3ZB9CY</a> traces without getting too poor to score the protected agenda. So, I switched it to <a href=\"/en/card/20122\">Red Herrings</a> which I think may be sufficient to open scoring windows in this environment to close the game (especially in conjunction with <a href=\"/en/card/20124\">False Lead</a>). A few  <a href=\"/en/card/20107\">Trick of Light</a>, give you an out for late game remote lock.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQpAMvmPd9A\">Round 1 can be watched here</a>, round 5 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pN7wLmzzwWI\">can be seen here</a>.</p>\n",

I have Kate and HB decks I'm quite happy with but I can been looking at if there are better options.</p>\n\n<p>I'm currently thinking that I should swap to Criminal, this would mean looking at Jinteki. I'm not sure about what makes a good Jinteki deck so I would like some advice please. I think I have added enough tricks to keep the runner honest and to play the shell game (maybe...????). The idea is to either win by scoring agenda or Flat Lining with Tags and SE/Neural EMP.</p>\n\n<p>Any help would be great thanks</p>\n\n<p>Ben</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>Our Meta got into a pretty good discussion about bringing in new players.  We realized we hadn't had a new player in quite some time and perhaps that has to do with the cost to pick up all the cards in one fell swoop.  While some from other trading cards games might not have a problem spending a few hundred bucks, people who aren't total board/card game enthusiasts might be put off by the \"start-up fee.\"</p>\n\n<p>SO--we thought one solution might be Core + Big Boxes only events.  It gives the veteran players a slightly bigger card pool to play with, but it also won't be overwhelming to a player new to ANR.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding this deck:</p>\n\n<p>I think it should be pretty standard fare.  Not having played it (this is the first draft), it looks like it will be a bit more midrangey.  I'm concerned about the econ, but also don't know what else I can do to bump that up.  Any suggestions would be welcome!</p>\n",

I thought about throwing in some BEANSTALK for added economy, but thought it would A-be too money driven and wasn't needed B-didn't want to drop the other out of faction additions.</p>\n\n<p>While you build your economy fairly easily, and have huge ICE towers, you can look for the opportunity to MEAT and NET your runner to death. With things, like SNARE - SEA SOURCE - SCORCHED EARTH - PRIVATE SECURITY AGENDA you have the opportunity to wreck the runner. </p>\n\n<p>Even if you don't, they will be thinking about it when they have a TAG or 2 on them, and see your first SNARE pop up.</p>\n\n<p>I like have some cheaper early game ICE options for SENTRY, BARRIER, and CODE GATE added in there for the bigger spread of ICE types and prices. Originally I had some NBN - MATRIX ANALYZERS but opted out for the SEA SOURCEs.</p>\n\n<p>Plenty of money to complete agendas, pay for your SNARE, and rez those expensive ICEs.</p>\n",

So I went with HAP for some funny Jinteki shenanigans and I like criminal in general.</p>\n\n<p>The tournament was 4 rounds of swiss, 9 players, I got a bye in the first round.\nAfter that I went 2-2 (runner wins), 2-2 (corp wins, both flatlines), 4-0 (Jinteki flatline). It was a really fun tournament and a great format to attract newer players since you don't need all cards.</p>\n\n<p>So this is a fairly standard aggro criminal deck, with some extra run events for Ken. Because of the format I could only take 1 Desperado, so I went with Logos instead. It worked out pretty good, my econ was quite solid without it. The game I lost was vs a rich BABW. I got 4 points of a Legwork, but that was followed by a Power Shutdown>Jackson>Accelerated Diagnostics>double Punitive. Not much I could've done except throw in a crash space or two, getting equal on econ would be too hard I think.</p>\n",

Since I have SMC and special order, I don't necessarily need multiples of each ice breaker. I either get the breaker in my hand, or the card necessary to find the breaker.  The focus is to build up an economy and breaker suite quickly enough to attack R&amp;D repeatedly.  It's not an exciting deck, it feels like, but a practical one.</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>This was my corp deck for the 2018 Stimhack Revised Core 2.0 tournament, claiming top spot. With Weyland having a more economic ability than the other 3 factions, I decided to go with the heavy ice route to tax the runner out of credits with bluffs if they're set up. It does struggle against \"infinite money\" Magnum Opus builds and the plan then is to rush as fast as possible. Getting a 2 Agenda Counter Project Atlas (5 advancement tokens) helps massively to progress though.</p>\n\n<p>The deck has the maximum number of transaction operations available in the revised core set. Trick of Light is a great fast advance tool for the revised core pool as it costs 1 less influence than Biotic Labor and more importantly, costs only 1 credit. Despite being a rich corp, the ice is very expensive to rez and almost prohibitive against Reina, so every credit counts. Use GRNDL if needed to get ahead.</p>\n\n<p>For ice placement, ideally you'll want Archer near the end of your remote (watch out for Femme) and Tollbooth on your R&amp;D or HQ, whichever is more critical (Chaos Theory and Reina: R&amp;D, Gabe: HQ).</p>\n\n<p>Project Junebug is used for baiting runs into the remote, alongside GRNDL, and if they don't run it, you can always use the advancements for Trick of Light. Melange is also good bluff fodder and you can always get the credits if you're low.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks go to FightingWalloon for organising the tournament and also everyone who helped me test the deck through it's various forms!</p>\n\n<p>Changes from my previous deck:</p>\n\n<p>Removed:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Caduceus x1\nPunitive Counterstrike x1\nShipment from Kaguya x1\nThe Cleaners x1\nTollbooth x1\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Added:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Enigma x1\nGRNDL Refinery x1\nPrivate Security Force x1\nProject Junebug x2\n</code></pre>\n",

    "description": "<p>Start with Basic Deck Building process by combining all Criminal (32 cards) with all Neutral (15 cards). This is a good start but now I have 47 cards while the minimum for this ID is 45 cards. It's better to go minimum to increase draw consistency. Let's get to it step-by-step:</p>\n\n<p>[1] Breaker of ICEs. I have a total of (5) Killers, (3) Fracters and (3) Decoders and (2) AIs. I have a mix of everything.</p>\n\n<p>[2] Economic Engine. Generally 9-12 cards in total. In fact, I have 14 in total.</p>\n\n<p>[4] Use Influence. This ID comes with up to 15 to spend. Use influence to import tricks to confuse and surprise the Corp or to shore up weaknesses in the deck. Here's my thought process for this faction teaching deck.<br />\n- added <a href=\"/en/card/01043\">Gordian Blade</a> for a more efficient Code Gate breaker. \n- added <a href=\"/en/card/02106\">Indexing</a> just to throw off the Corp's tempo.<br />\n- added [<a href=\"/en/card/01008\">Datasucker</a> since I'll be running mostly centrals.<br />\n- added <a href=\"/en/card/01004\">Stimhack</a> for an emergency econ card which is ideal for possibly the last push to win the game.  </p>\n\n<p>[5] Cutting Cards. We have far more than needed to reach the minimum.<br />\n- removed <a href=\"/en/card/02006\">Peacock</a> since imported Gordian Blade.<br />\n- removed <a href=\"/en/card/01025\">Aurora</a> as there is enough breakers.<br />\n- removed <a href=\"/en/card/02028\">Dyson Mem Chip</a> as don't need 3.<br />\n- removed <a href=\"/en/card/02069\">Underworld Contact</a> as this ID starts with 0 link.  </p>\n\n<p>Every card should be readily understood, and there should be a minimum of rules clarifications necessary. Enjoy!</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>When I play runner, I like to play as aggressively as possible.  <a href=\"/en/card/01033\">Kate \"Mac\" McCaffrey: Digital Tinker</a> isn't the most aggressive runner, nor is Shaper the most aggressive faction.  But Kate can get a bit aggro if you play her that way.</p>\n\n<p>First off: <a href=\"/en/card/01034\">Diesel</a> is your best friend.  Drank the purple drank for lots of cards and don't care if you need to discard some at the end of your turn.  Drawing cards is second best if you can't drank Diesel.  Use <a href=\"/en/card/01035\">Modded</a> along with your ID discount to cheat out expensive programs (especially your second best friend, <a href=\"/en/card/01026\">Femme Fatale</a>) onto the board.  It also helps you keep under your hand limit of five.  Between Modded, the ID discount, <a href=\"/en/card/01053\">Armitage Codebusting</a> (early game), <a href=\"/en/card/01044\">Magnum Opus</a> (late game), <a href=\"/en/card/01024\">Desperado</a> (great anytime), and <a href=\"/en/card/01050\">Sure Gamble</a>, you should never be poor.</p>\n\n<p>Like I said, this is an Aggro Kate build (as aggro as you can get her in Core, for the most part). Cards like <a href=\"/en/card/01018\">Account Siphon</a>, <a href=\"/en/card/01024\">Desperado</a>, <a href=\"/en/card/01036\">The Maker's Eye</a>, <a href=\"/en/card/01037\">Tinkering</a>, <a href=\"/en/card/01051\">Crypsis</a>, <a href=\"/en/card/01026\">Femme Fatale</a> and most especially <a href=\"/en/card/01021\">Inside Job</a> allow you to go balls-to-the-wall with running early and often.  Inside Job and Tinkering are, in particular, fantastic for getting into places the corp thinks you can't go.  Similarly, <a href=\"/en/card/01049\">Infiltration</a> is the lone card that allows you to check for traps when you suspect their presence.  Store those up and never use them for money unless you get really desperate.</p>\n\n<p>The core set of ice breakers in this deck are <a href=\"/en/card/01043\">Gordian Blade</a>, one of the strongest, best code gate breakers still to this day, <a href=\"/en/card/01026\">Femme Fatale</a>, which allows you to bypass a selected ice instead of breaking it, and <a href=\"/en/card/01042\">Battering Ram</a>, a lackluster but respectable barrier breaker.  None of these are cheap, unfortunately, but hopefully you're making a lot of money along the way and you can get them out without putting a dent into your fortunes.  Resort to <a href=\"/en/card/01051\">Crypsis</a> only when you must, typically early in the game.</p>\n\n<p>The keys to success with this deck against any corp will be: draw draw draw, run run run, <a href=\"/en/card/01044\">Magnum Opus</a> for money, and always try to install at least once per turn.</p>\n",

    "name": "(Only 1x Core Set) Noise",
    "description": "<p>This is my 1x core set only Noise build, made for a \"learn to play Netrunner\" event where I thought attendees were likely to have limited access to the card pool.</p>\n\n<p>I never got to play much core set only because I started in early 2015, dived into local causal nights, and bought the big box expansions quickly. But in the few games I played this deck, it proved to be an absolute beast in core set matchups. It has decent econ (surprisingly hard in the core set!), breakers for every occasion (thanks, <a href=\"/en/card/01051\">Crypsis</a>!), and the ability to pressure all central servers. I never felt like the game was out of my control. It certainly lacks the power of modern Noise builds but it isn't a terrible deck to play if you're starting with a single box and want to compete.</p>\n\n<h3>Card Choices</h3>\n\n<p>Yes, I spent 100% of the influence importing Criminal economy cards. What of it?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/en/card/01018\">Account Siphon</a> is so strong and should probably be in <em>any</em> core-only deck. It's also the only HQ pressure available in the core, other than <a href=\"/en/card/01017\">Gabe's</a> ability, so it nicely rounds out Noise's well-balanced pressure. The deck is capable of floating tags if necessary, too, since only <a href=\"/en/card/01015\">Ice Carver</a> is a prime target for resource trashing.</p>\n\n<p>The operation-based economy gives us a lot of burst such that rebounding from zero credits is easy (<a href=\"/en/card/01019\">Mark</a>) and <a href=\"/en/card/01004\">Stimhack</a> ensures no remote is locked off. <a href=\"/en/card/01004\">Stimhack</a> and <a href=\"/en/card/01016\">Wyldside</a> have some anti-synergy but we don't care. Do drugs, hack servers, damage brains.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/en/card/01005\">Cyberfeeder</a> is so good and so necessary. Again, helps the deck work even with low economy and plays well with tags. <a href=\"/en/card/01029\">Bank Job</a> can be tough to pull off at times, e.g. late game when we're tagged and have only 3<span class=\"icon icon-click\"></span> because we been <a href=\"/en/card/01016\">partying at the club</a>, but we are money hungry anarchists so we use it.</p>\n\n<p>The anarch core set breakers are, to this day, played because of their great efficiency. Other than <a href=\"/en/card/01026\">Femme Fatale</a> and <a href=\"/en/card/01043\">Gordian Blade</a>, they're the only playable breakers out of the core, even. The suite here blanks a lot of ICE, especially in core (Neural Katana, Viktor 1.0, Rototurret all go from great to useless), and has <a href=\"/en/card/01051\">Crypsis</a> to fill in the gaps. Hopefully the econ means we actually have <span class=\"icon icon-credit\"></span>s to pay for using Crypsis, too.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/en/card/01009\">Djinn</a> is there because the MU is tight with only a single copy of <a href=\"/en/card/01006\">Grimoire</a>, not really for tutoring our few viruses. <a href=\"/en/card/01010\">Medium</a> provides the R&amp;D pressure, rounding out our ability to strike all the centrals <em>hard</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The 3x <a href=\"/en/card/01049\">Infiltration</a> is literally because I ran out of useful cards. I'm loathe to add <a href=\"/en/card/01003\">Demolition Run</a>, which is of such niche usage, or <a href=\"/en/card/01013\">Wyrm</a>, which just costs entirely too much to be fruitful. At least with Infiltration you can a) win the Jinteki matchup easily, &amp; b) take credits as a backup plan.</p>\n\n<h3>Notable Exclusions</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"/en/card/01047\">Aesop's Pawnshop</a> is the economic backbone of modern Noise, so you might expect to see it here. I found that it was hard to use and, with only one copy in the core set, hard to find. We're not churning through viruses like <a href=\"/en/card/06037\">Cache</a> and <a href=\"/en/card/06014\">Lamprey</a> with only core set cards, so it just doesn't make sense. I might sell a single <a href=\"/en/card/01008\">Datasucker</a> or <a href=\"/en/card/01016\">Wyldside</a>, but at that rate <a href=\"/en/card/01029\">Bank Job</a> is better and more consistently usable economy. Aesop's also doesn't work well with floating tags.</p>\n\n<p>The other way to build this would be to drop the Wyldside draw engine and go for 3x <a href=\"/en/card/01034\">Diesel</a>, ditching 1x <a href=\"/en/card/01018\">Siphon</a> &amp; 1x <a href=\"/en/card/01029\">Bank Job</a>. While Wyldside without <a href=\"/en/card/08003\">pancakes</a> feels awful, I couldn't give it up as an influence-free draw engine. If the game state demands it, we can always just <span class=\"icon icon-click\"></span> for cards the good ol' fashioned way.</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>Taking a look at all the corp identities, my eye was immediately drawn to Jinteki. Not only for the sexy, subtly threatening colour scheme, but for the <em>mind games.</em> beautiful mind games. I don't know Gabe, <em>is</em> that a <a href=\"/en/card/01069\">Project Junebug</a> that I'm hoping you'll run into? Or maybe it's a <a href=\"/en/card/01106\">Priority Requisition</a> that gets me three steps closer to buying Earth. Why not risk it? <em>What do you have to lose?</em> <strong><em>Always be running, am I right?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Of course, having played a few games with a deck like this, most of the net damage shenanigans (Like your <a href=\"/en/card/02095\">Hokusai Grid</a>s or your <a href=\"/en/card/01072\">Neural EMP</a>s) are more there to tax the runner rather than actually <em>kill</em> them, but that can still be really effective or even devastating. That said, an unprepared runner encountering a sneaky <a href=\"/en/card/01070\">Snare!</a> can easily win you the game there and then. And what happens if nobody falls for your <a href=\"/en/card/01069\">Project Junebug</a>? Simple. Buy a smoke machine, close the windows and doors for maximum effect, and play a <a href=\"/en/card/02033\">Trick of Light</a> to move those counters onto something more agenda-y.</p>\n\n<p>Sadly, pursuing honourable tactics, brain mapping, cloning, and <em>certainly not psionics</em> means that there's not a lot of time for Jinteki to actually make some money. Outside of <a href=\"/en/card/04012\">Celebrity Gift</a>, all your economy is going to have to be neutral or imported. Hope you like living off <a href=\"/en/card/01109\">PAD Campaign</a>s and <a href=\"/en/card/01108\">Melange Mining Corp.</a></p>\n\n<p>Ice-wise, Jinteki is kind of interesting. <a href=\"/en/card/04033\">Swordsman</a> laughs at Crypsis, <a href=\"/en/card/04093\">Yagura</a> is a fun card to place in front of R&amp;D to reduce their chances of stealing agendas, and while <a href=\"/en/card/04013\">Himitsu-Bako</a> will stave off early aggression, late game it's mostly fun to just bounce it and make them guess whether what I placed is another box to be solved or a <a href=\"/en/card/01078\">Wall of Thorns</a> to be feared.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, this is probably not the best deck you can build out of the Jinteki parts, but it's one I've had great fun piloting, with most of my wins coming from flatlines anyways. Scare the runner out of running, and you scare him out the game.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Oh, and don't be like me and forget all your <a href=\"/en/card/01067\">Jinteki: Personal Evolution</a> triggers.</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Made with one Revised Core Set</em></p>\n",

    "description": "<p>Took to a newbie tournament that was core + 1 deluxe only. Placed 5th of 13, losing to the eventual 1st and 2nd place players.</p>\n\n<p>I was much more confident than with my <a href=\"http://netrunnerdb.com/en/deck/edit/402110\">Corp deck</a>.  The idea was to take advantage of the lack of Jackson Howard and trash lots of stuff to the archives.  Then Inside Job whatever ice was there (worst case scenario - femme any other ice on it).  In practice this deck had good luck tearing stuff apart, though it felt a bit of a hybrid between core and eater.  I just love <a href=\"/en/card/07035\">Wanton Destruction</a> so much though!</p>\n\n<p>First game was against the eventual champion.  <a href=\"http://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/25407/pretty-pickings-from-the-meat-corpse\">deck here</a>. As it was my first tournament, I was still settling into it (though more excitement and hype than nerves in this case) and made several mistakes.  Opponent was very patient (though I refused to take back bad moves on principle) and played very well.</p>\n\n<p>Second game was against a relative newbie so was a relatively easy win - another very friendly opponent.  Third game I got very lucky running R&amp;D, trashing anything useless to archives, and re-running and managed to steal lots of agenda very quickly.  Won within a few turns,very lucky.</p>\n\n<p>My luck came to a grinding halt in the final game, against a player from my local meta who I've played many times before.  <a href=\"http://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/25449/hb-s-suprise-delux\">deck here</a>. I managed to trash the ice on his R&amp;D at the same time as getting a <a href=\"/en/card/01010\">Medium</a> out, and just kept running and running.  He was ahead (about 5-1) and I kept digging and digging but never found any agendas.  Not sure I deserved to win, but definitely deserved something from my R&amp;D runs.  He held his nerve and scored out to win and take 2nd place.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, a great day.  I really enjoyed all my games and my opponents were very friendly.  I will definitely tournament again.</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>Like many newbies after a couple of months of playing online and with a friend, I decide it was time to find a local store championship to test out my skill. Feeling very nervous at first as only had a single core set and not really sure what to expect but it turned out great as many before me has stated in a many forums that the core set really has a lot of good cards.</p>\n\n<p>Firstly let talk about the deck and please fell free to advice/comment as my selections are due to my current limited card pool (1 core set only), knowledge and experience.</p>\n\n<p>Corporate: HB ETF</p>\n\n<p>Why did I built this deck?\nWell after playing testing all 4 Corporate factions in the core set, HB was the only faction I felt I could build a pretty wall of ICE and have a scoring chance providing econ was on my side to compete in a tournament. The idea behind it was simple build a remote server with a wall of ICE - inspired by many decks on the Internet.  </p>\n\n<p>Strengths:\nEasy for a newbie to pick and understand, can't really misplay. Very direct, get econ and ICE up to limited access fast and score out quick. I would suggest virtually always mulligan if no econ card to begin with. </p>\n\n<p>Weakness:\nSome very high cost ICE to rez as seen in my Round 1 Game 1 - lose the econ and you are done for.\nABT - this is a double edge sword as seen in my Round 3 Game 2 - if you reveal 3 ICE great then likely to continue scoring agenda, else if agenda you are in trouble defending archives.</p>\n\n<p>Card Selection:\nKeep the econ coming with Adonis Campaign, Pad Campaign, Melange Mining if desperate or lucky enough to rez. \nDirect income from Hedge fund and Beanstalk Royalties.\nClick economy with Shipment selection. In fact as per my Round 3 Game 2 needed both SfM to get a head start and finishing with SfK to score out the last agenda. Situational I know but what your opponent mouth drop when you turn that SfK to help score when then thought they did enough to make you broke.\nArchived Memories - needed for either econ or desperately getting back an agenda after ABT\nICE - pretty standard , try to use ones which has end turn. Data Raven, the tag is important if you can score out a Private Security Force and makes opponent wonder if you have a scorched.</p>\n\n<p>Netrunner Spring 2016 Store Tournament Report </p>\n\n<p>Date: 21st may 2016<br />\nVenue: TheHobbitHole - Chatteris\nFormat: Swiss rounds 3</p>\n\n<p>My runner deck can be found &lt;<a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/35409/criminal-gabriel-core-only\">https://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/35409/criminal-gabriel-core-only</a>&gt;</p>\n\n<p>Round 1 Game 1: HB ETF vs Kate (Lose, 0pt)\nVery slow start, pretty much agenda bomb had 3 agendas in my hand most of the time and lost pretty quick apart from scoring an early agenda. Unable to tags and the runner keep trashing my Adonis Campaign to keep me poor. \nAgenda 2-7</p>\n\n<p>Round 1 Game 2: Gabriel VS NEH (Modified Win, 1pt) \nThis was pressure game, running like criminal does, early and hard on HQ, scored a couple of points and then the Corp rallied. Agenda was 2-3 when time was called just after he installed an agenda into server leaving me with one last hoorah run. First click, Account Siphon to make Corp poor and not enough to rez next runs set of ICEs and then to take further tag on Data Raven to score additional 2 pt agenda for the modified 1 points win and leaving opponent with 0. </p>\n\n<p>Agenda 4-3 </p>\n\n<p>End of Round 1 Score: 1pt</p>\n\n<p>Round 2 Game 1: HB ETF vs Noise (Win, 2pts)\nThis is a very quick game. I opened scoring a Private Security Force on an open server on turn as runner was only interested in milling R&amp;D into archives and upping the virus counters with incubator and medium. He was that confident he even float tags without batting an eye lid even when running on R&amp;D against my Data Raven. He went 6-2 up in no time and with pressure on I had to change tactic. Firstly waste a turn to purge virus and then another turn do a 3-click meat damage with my scored Private Security Force to help reduce his attack options as he was breaking with Faust. He didn't care as he had worse (Anarch = I Had Worse) and was gaining 3 cards when I was doing meat damage, but eventually slip up when he was too eager and left with 2 cards in hand after missing a 4 card medium dig. PSF killed with 3 click meat damage. </p>\n\n<p>Agenda 2-6 but Runner flatlined</p>\n\n<p>Round 2 Game 2: Gabriel vs NEH (Modified Win, 1pt)\nA very fast start from Corp in getting Breaking News for the single point lead and then ambushing me with News Team for -1 agenda. I had to keep the Corp poor as he was quick with remote servers and asset. AS to the rescue. With the econ battle in my favour I could risk both snares and ghost branch then using crash space to pay for tags and finally finding desperado and data dealer to get rid of 2 News Team which was turning point and went on to win the game on 5-2 after time was called. </p>\n\n<p>Agenda 5-2</p>\n\n<p>End of Round 2 Score: 4pts</p>\n\n<p>Round 3 Game 1: Gabriel vs Replicating Perfection (Win, 2pts)\nFeeling more at home and relaxed the cards just seem to come at the right time. The corp had an agenda rush and no econ as I AS and then constant run on HQ with Desperado together with a open server explosion agenda to finish quick. </p>\n\n<p>Agenda 8-0</p>\n\n<p>Round 3 Game 2: HB ETF vs Kate (Win, 2pts)\nWith confidence up, I knew I was in with a chance of top to two. Brilliant first hand with Shipment for Mirrormorph to install 3 ICE, Adonis Campaigning and Hedge Funds. 10 credits and runner was slow to setup leaving lots of earlier opportunities - when 4-0 up then played for ABT which could have been a costly move; sending 2 agenda into archives. I could only protect with Tollboth at the time and later spend the next few turns bulking up archives but was too late. Runner soon caught up to 6-5. But as he went for the finish he hit an Ichi with no sentry breakers. Next turn install ABT, but I was limited in money down to 7 with 2 unrezzed ice Engina and Rototurret. The runner was clever forcing me to use my money even if he couldn't in. Luckily I had a Pad Campaign already rezzed and 2 shipment from kaaguya in hand to score out.  </p>\n\n<p>Agenda 7-5</p>\n\n<p>End of Round 3 Score: 8pts</p>\n",

    "description": "<p><em>We've been playing a lot of Core Decks in our Northern Irish meta recently both to encourage new players but also as the games have been seriously fun and surprising.</em></p>\n\n<p>An old school introduction to <strong>Fast Advance</strong> with SanSan City Grid and Biotic Labour along side the full asset econ from the Core Set. You will require 3x Core Sets if you would like to run all 3 SSCG but you can always pop in an extra Tollbooth for taxation if you're unable to get the 3 grids.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Playing the Deck</strong> - A New Players Guide<br />\nThe goal really is to money up early and lightly ICE your Centrals as you get Adonis, Pad Campaign and Melange Mining Core going. Putting a couple of ICE in front of a Melange that you can later replace with a SanSan City Grid is a great way to get your econ going and look to score some back-to-back agendas.</p>\n\n<p>As soon as you have a remote with a big ICE like Wall of Thorns, Tollbooth or Heimdall 1.0 and a bit of an economy lead, look to get your SanSan down for a Score from hand. You can add in 1 Biotic Labour for 4/2 or 2 Biotic Labour if you want to get really spicy and score a 5/3 from hand. You can also drop a SanSan City Grid down on it's own, which if the runner runs, is daunting to pay 5 credits for.</p>\n\n<p>A core set trick I like to consider is triggering an Accelerated Beta Test with a click to spare to allow for an Archived Memories to save me should I dump an Agenda I really don't want to give away.</p>\n\n<p>Az</p>\n",

This means making sure you have something taggey (ideally <a href=\"/en/card/01088\">Data Raven</a>) in front of both R&amp;D and HQ, probably.</p>\n\n<p>If you're facing a deck with <a href=\"/en/card/01011\">Mimic</a> in it, scoring <a href=\"/en/card/09005\">Improved Tracers</a> is huge for your <a href=\"/en/card/01089\">Matrix Analyzer</a>s and <a href=\"/en/card/09018\">Turnpike</a>s and make most of your other ice just... <em>gross</em> for the runner.</p>\n\n<p>Don't worry if the runner scores a few agendas. Seven the 11 agendas are worth only 1 point and the other 4 are only worth 2 points to them, so they're going to need plenty of accesses to get to 7. Plus, you should be handing them negative points with <a href=\"/en/card/09009\">News Team</a>.</p>\n\n<p>To make the most of those <a href=\"/en/card/01099\">Scorched Earth</a>, <a href=\"/en/card/01084\">Closed Accounts</a> and <a href=\"/en/card/09022\">The All-Seeing I</a> threats, try to cheese out your <a href=\"/en/card/01082\">Breaking News</a>es by playing them one turn and scoring them the next so you can take advantage of the tags.</p>\n",

Some of it is cheap, and then it ramps up farther.  Meanwhile, you should be trying to advance stuff; Biotic Labor is great for hard-advancing things, particularly Accelerated Beta Test to ramp up to a good fortress.  (This is also one of the two best ways to get Archer out, the other being Priority Requisition.)</p>\n\n<p>I have a small amount of tagging stuff (Data Raven, Ichi 1.0) for the purpose of giving Private Security Force teeth, but PSF is really only there because I need all of the core set agendas to hit the point requirements.</p>\n",

The idea is you have to make your Corp and Runner decks form just these two sets (although you are allow to use three core sets). I'm trying to work out if I want to run Kate + Core HB fast advance or Noise and something Weyland (either bad and tag or fast advance).</p>\n\n<p>Not having a lot of \"main\" cards makes things very tough. I decided to try an Atman Parasite deck with as much recursion as possible, so Clone Chips and Scavenge so I can remove the Atman and bring them back at different strengths if needed. I also have Femme to get me out of a whole if I need it.</p>\n\n<p>I think I have economy down with Daily Casts, Dirty Laundry and Sure Gamble + Desperado for running credits. Stimhack for a nice lot of burst economy for that must do run.</p>\n\n<p>But without plascrete is this a waste of time? Would I be better with Noise and I Have Had Worse for some protection?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for any advice</p>\n\n<p>Ben</p>\n",

Since the ID is about taking advantage of transactions we should look for more of these later.</p>\n\n<p>[4] Use Influence. This ID comes with up to 15 to spend. Use influence to import tricks to confuse and surprise the Runner or to shore up weaknesses in the deck. Here's my thought process for this faction teaching deck.<br />\n- added <a href=\"/en/card/01090\">Tollbooth</a> for ETR and to snipe the Runner's bank.<br />\n- added <a href=\"/en/card/01063\">Viktor 1.0</a> to shore up Weyland's lack of Code Gates.<br />\n- added <a href=\"/en/card/02070\">Green Level Clearance</a> as transaction cards.<br />\n- added <a href=\"/en/card/02033\">Trick of Light</a> to move advancement tokens.  </p>\n\n<p>[5] Cutting Cards. We have far more than needed to reach 49 cards in total.<br />\n- removed <a href=\"/en/card/04117\">Hive</a> and <a href=\"/en/card/01113\">Wall of Static</a> one of each due to excess Barrier ICEs.\n- removed <a href=\"/en/card/01112\">Hunter</a> leaving just one since we have <a href=\"/en/card/01104\">Shadow</a>.<br />\n- removed <a href=\"/en/card/01108\">Melange Mining Corp.</a> in favor of GRNDL as this piece is also advanceable.<br />\n- removed <a href=\"/en/card/01109\">PAD Campaign</a> due to excess econ cards.</p>\n\n<p>Every card should be readily understood, and there should be a minimum of rules clarifications necessary. Enjoy!</p>\n",

    "name": "HB (EtF) - Economy & Traps (Deck from Single Core Set)",
    "description": "<p>Just like everyone else, I started learning to play A:NR with Jinteki Vs. Kate (as the rulebook suggests). I played too many games as corp only with a single runner friend (playing Kate of course) and I always felt so poor. Not many ways to make <span class=\"icon icon-credit\"></span>credits other than <span class=\"icon icon-click\"></span>clicking for it or <a href=\"/en/card/01110\">Hedge Fund</a> if I'm lucky enough, while on the other side there was a juicy <a href=\"en/card/01044\">Magnum Opus</a> for up to 8cr per turn. Frustrated as I was, I started researching for my first deckbuilding. Rules were simple enough regarding Agendas and Influence, but I still couldn't make my core <a href=\"en/card/01067\">Jinteki</a> deck rich enough. How can I protect myself if I can't pay 4<span class=\"icon icon-credit\"></span> for a <a href=\"/en/card/01070\">Snare!</a> or advance a <a href=\"/en/card/01069\">Project Junebug</a>? Then I went exploring other factions and Voila...<a href=\"en/card/01054\">Haas Bioroid</a> and its amazing ability: 1 free <span class=\"icon icon-credit\"></span> for each installation...1 free <span class=\"icon icon-credit\"></span> almost every turn.</p>\n\n<p>I must admit, I wasn't taking a lot of risks to be able to play Jinteki correctly as a shell game, with multiple servers of open traps and open agendas. I turned to HB for a glacier approach, with most of my games ending with a tower of ICEs on a single server, sometimes up to 5 cards of different subtypes (avoiding more than two Code Gates, because of <a href=\"en/card/01043\">Gordian Blade's</a> ability keeping its strength). A Code Gate plus a couple of Barriers and maaaybe a Sentry somewhere in the fort, worked best. I usually avoid sentries in the beginning because they lack ETR and the runner usually runs naked in the beginning. I could lay them there as investment but what about <a href=\"en/card/01020\">Forged Activation Orders</a>? They destroy the element of surprise mid-game. Long story short, my deck was packed with ICE and economy, Adonis, Melange, PADs, Beanstalks, Hedge Funds. Nothing else, no traps, no tagging, not even upgrades.</p>\n\n<p>Everything was going better against my Netrunner buddy as I started winning more often, until I found some new players to test the deck and lost miserably. One day I lost at 11-0 agenda points at a single game, when one guy run into R&amp;D with <a href=\"en/card/01036\">The Maker's Eye</a> and found two 3p agendas!! These runners were attacking aggressively every turn and I finally learned how much can <a href=\"en/card/01004\">Stimhack</a> hurt. Like a big guy kicking you right on the balls and then going retard, just so he can kick you again next round going full retard with another Stimhack. And then I remembered Jinteki...Good old punishing Jinteki, net-hurting those f***ing runners.</p>\n\n<p>I went home crying like a little bitch just to prepare for revenge. I packed my deck with <a href=\"/en/card/01070\">Snares</a>, <a href=\"/en/card/01057\">Aggressive Secretaries</a>, <a href=\"/en/card/01076\">Data Mines</a> and <a href=\"/en/card/01075\">Chums</a>...and guess what, it worked like a charm. After the runner stimhacked a remote server packed with ICE just to stumble upon an installed Snare...oh man, bitch got her revenge and tasted some run-tears.</p>\n\n<p>I revised the deck a few times since that game, because I was only carrying the min 45 cards and got agenda flood multiple games resulting in a 50-50 win. In a few occasions I was forced to play shell game just to get rid of a few agendas from HQ, like installing an open agenda and a trap under ICE and it worked. Then I took it even further as to install two agendas out of hand advancing both of them next turn. The runner stole the one and got scared to check the other. I left it there double-advanced for many turns , managed to score another and came back to it to finish the game. Boy, that was fun.</p>\n\n<p>Long story short, this deck can be played both glacier or shell, depending on opening hand. As far as revisions go, I ditched the <a href=\"/en/card/01076\">Data Mines</a> for some <a href=\"/en/card/01069\">Project Junebugs</a> since this deck isn't primarily focused on net-damaging the runner and one point net damage can't hurt much, but a triple advanced <a href=\"/en/card/01069\">PJ</a> can destroy him, even a double adv. <a href=\"/en/card/01069\">PJ</a> can set the runner far behind. I wasn't sure about <a href=\"/en/card/01057\">Aggressive Secretaries</a> either, going back and forth on removing them. At the end I kept them in deck to help with Agenda flood. I also included <a href=\"/en/card/01058\">Archived Memories</a> to recycle either the traps or the economy and ditched <a href=\"/en/card/01101\">Archers</a> for <a href=\"/en/card/01090\">Tollbooths</a>. I couldn't wait for a <a href=\"/en/card/01106\">Priority Requisition</a> to rez an Archer and Tollbooth is a great alternative for keeping the runner poor without having to forfeit agendas or hoping on scoring a <a href=\"/en/card/01106\">PR</a>. <a href=\"/en/card/01058\">AM</a> also saved me a few times from <a href=\"en/card/01001\">Noise's</a> ability, trashing an agenda.</p>\n\n<p>As for agendas in general, don't use <a href=\"/en/card/01055\">Accelerated Beta Test's</a> feature...it sucks! Unless you see your deck thin and not much ICE on the table, then maaaaybe you'll get lucky and find ICE on the top 3 cards of R&amp;D. Otherwise you'll end up with one cheap-ass ICE just discovered, rezzed over the Archives because the other two cards were agendas, or even end up with 2 agendas and an econ. card discarded just like that...with no protection whatsoever and your deck 3 cards thinner. And who's gonna save you? Only <a href=\"/en/card/01058\">AM</a> IF you're extremely lucky to have it in HQ. <a href=\"/en/card/01107\">Private Security Force</a> also sucks, only good for <a href=\"en/card/01080\">NBN</a> and <a href=\"en/card/01093\">Weyland</a> in the core set, but what can you do? Funny thing, at one of my games the runner <a href=\"en/card/01018\">Siphoned</a> me keeping the tags and leaving an open triple advanced <a href=\"/en/card/01107\">PSF</a>. My turn: <a href=\"/en/card/01109\">PAD Campaign's</a> free credit, adv+scoring <a href=\"/en/card/01107\">PSF</a> and two meat damage right there. His next turn had to get rid of the tags with two clicks and draw cards, thus <a href=\"/en/card/01107\">PSF</a> can rarely be useful. What am I saying, rethinking it...it still sucks balls! <a href=\"/en/card/01106\">PR</a> FTW in this deck.</p>\n\n<p>A comment on a few HB cards I removed...<a href=\"/en/card/01059\">Biotic Labor</a>, this card is useless to HB in the core set. You can't use HB for fast advancing, well maaaaybe an <a href=\"/en/card/01055\">ABT</a> but that's pretty much it and it costs 7<span class=\"icon icon-credit\"></span>. <a href=\"/en/card/01060\">Shipment from MirrorMorph</a>? I'd rather earn 3 free <span class=\"icon icon-credit\"></span> upon installing the cards, even if it takes me 3 turns and 3<span class=\"icon icon-click\"></span>. <a href=\"/en/card/01065\">Corporate Troubleshooter</a> and <a href=\"/en/card/01066\">Experiential Data</a> are fine upgrades but easily <span class=\"icon icon-trash\"></span>trashed, only good for mid to late game, so why bother? I'd rather put another ICE on the server.</p>\n\n<p>As for other influence, I would love to add <a href=\"/en/card/01102\">Hadrian's Walls</a>, <a href=\"/en/card/01079\">Akitaro Watanabe</a>, <a href=\"/en/card/01091\">Red Herrings</a> but either there's not enough room, or they're 1offs and I hate including 1offs. At my earlier builds I was carrying <a href=\"/en/card/01083\">Anonymous Tip</a> but then, I prefer taking things slow focusing on economy and ICE building.</p>\n\n<p>This is my first published deck, trying to help newcomers understand the glacier power of HB in the core set and giving a few tips on strategy/tactics. I appreciate any suggestions from experienced players.</p>\n\n<p>PS: add one more ichi for a 49-card deck. Or a Biotic Labor, it may come in handy</p>\n",

Here's my thought process for this faction teaching deck.<br />\n- added <a href=\"/en/card/01026\">Femme Fatale</a> for its bypass ability. \n- added <a href=\"/en/card/01003\">Demolition Run</a>, <a href=\"/en/card/02043\">Emergency Shutdown</a>, <a href=\"/en/card/20026\">HQ Interface</a> and <a href=\"/en/card/04101\">Singularity</a> just to throw off the Corp's tempo.  </p>\n\n<p>[5] Cutting Cards. We have far more than needed to reach the minimum.<br />\n- removed <a href=\"/en/card/01046\">Pipeline</a> except for one.<br />\n- removed <a href=\"/en/card/01051\">Crypsis</a>, <a href=\"/en/card/01042\">Battering Ram</a> and <a href=\"/en/card/01043\">Gordian Blade</a> one of each since deck is already draw efficient with 40 cards and <a href=\"/en/card/01034\">Diesel</a>.<br />\n- removed <a href=\"/en/card/01047\">Aesop's Pawnshop</a> in favor of <a href=\"/en/card/01044\">Magnum Opus</a> and to meet NAPD MWL 2.1 requirement.<br />\n- removed <a href=\"/en/card/01053\">Armitage Codebusting</a> as I can use <a href=\"/en/card/01044\">Magnum Opus</a> to click for creds.<br />\n- removed <a href=\"/en/card/02028\">Dyson Mem Chip</a> as this ID has extra mem to begin with and coupled with <a href=\"/en/card/02048\">Dinosaurus</a> I'm good to go.<br />\n- removed <a href=\"/en/card/01049\">Infiltration</a> as I have enough econ cards and to meet 40 cards :) </p>\n\n<p>Every card should be readily understood, and there should be a minimum of rules clarifications necessary. Enjoy!</p>\n",

These decklists exist in a bubble, so \u201cMeta\u201d picks are hard to judge (Sharon Claire and/or Cyberdex Virus Suite vs. Noise, Damage protection for runners), so that\u2019s pretty much for you to decide.

    "description": "<p>This is an official FFG sample deck, as shared in this article http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=4655</p>\n\n<p>It may not be the <em>most</em> competitive deck out there, but it is a viable deck created from only a single core set and Honor &amp; Profit, and vastly better than the nonsense deck provided in the Honor &amp; Profit insert. So it's an excellent option for new players who only own these expansions so far.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><strong>Official Description</strong></p>\n\n<p>Several popular Android: Netrunner identities offer players economic rewards for meeting various triggers: installing programs or hardware, running on HQ, or installing cards from HQ. Nisei Division (Honor and Profit, 2) joins these identities, allowing a Jinteki player to gain a credit whenever he or she reveals any number of secretly spent credits. Naturally, all such identities are most effective when their triggers are met as many times as possible, so these identities tend to encourage highly focused deck builds. To further explore how a Jinteki player might take advantage of the Nisei Division identity, we present this sample deck list, created from just one Core Set and a copy of Honor and Profit.</p>\n\n<p>Like many Jinteki decks, \u201cBait &amp; Blast\u201d plays a bit of a shell game; it wants to create a good number of remote servers, dare the Runner to run at them, and catch the Runner off-guard with a lethal Ambush.</p>\n\n<p>The deck is light on ice, but it has a decent assortment of ice select to end runs, strain the Runner\u2019s credits, and deal net damage. Meanwhile, the deck\u2019s economy is driven forward by a number of operations, including <a href=\"/en/card/05026\">Diversified Portfolio</a>, which becomes more effective as the game goes on and you can create additional remote servers. It gains additional efficiencies with cards like <a href=\"/en/card/05015\">Mushin No Shin</a> and <a href=\"/en/card/01100\">Shipment from Kaguya</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, because this deck is built around the Nisei Division identity and its focus on secret bids, it includes a number of cards that create such secret bids. Currently, in Android: Netrunner, secret bids are the signature effect of Jinteki\u2019s Psi cards, so \u201cBait &amp; Blast\u201d leans heavily upon a trio of Psi cards that appear in Honor and Profit \u2013 <a href=\"/en/card/05007\">The Future Perfect</a>, <a href=\"/en/card/05010\">Psychic Field</a>, and <a href=\"/en/card/05013\">Cerebral Cast</a>.</p>\n\n<p>As you can see, each of these cards introduces a powerful gamble. Win, and you can prevent the Runner from stealing three agenda points, wipe out his grip, or give him a brain damage or tag. Lose, and you find yourself short of the credits you wagered, as well as any investment you made into installing, advancing, or playing the card.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, if you do the math, it would appear that two-thirds of the time, you should win these wagers, but Jinteki\u2019s Psi cards represent the corporation\u2019s research into the untapped potential of the human mind. They point to information that lies beyond the commonly accepted limitations of human perception, and if you can tap that information, perhaps you can shift the odds more fully in your favor with each of these wagers.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, each of these gambles plays into your larger strategy. Your deck doesn\u2019t test itself against the Runner; it tests the Runner. It dares the Runner to pursue your agenda points. It dares him to hunt for agendas in servers that you\u2019ve lined full of traps. It dares him to run blind, and it dares him to expose cards. With \u201cBait &amp; Blast,\u201d you set the Runner upon a razor\u2019s edge, forcing him to run without slipping even once, and if he should ever slip, you have a host of cards to deal net damage, brain damage, and even meat damage.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>(Note: The deck as published has an error - it is 50 cards. I reduced Diversified Portfolio from 3x to 2x to correct this.)</p>\n",

This means making sure you have something taggey (ideally <a href=\"/en/card/01088\">Data Raven</a>) in front of both R&amp;D and HQ, probably.</p>\n\n<p>If you're facing a deck with <a href=\"/en/card/01011\">Mimic</a> in it, scoring <a href=\"/en/card/09005\">Improved Tracers</a> is huge for your <a href=\"/en/card/01089\">Matrix Analyzer</a>s and <a href=\"/en/card/09018\">Turnpike</a>s and make most of your other ice just... <em>gross</em> for the runner.</p>\n\n<p>Don't worry if the runner scores a few agendas. Seven the 11 agendas are worth only 1 point and the other 4 are only worth 2 points to them, so they're going to need plenty of accesses to get to 7.

    "description": "<p>I'm building some decks with only the Core Set plus all three deluxe expansions to see what types of archetypes are will be available permanently throughout Netrunner's lifecycle. I'll put <a href=\"/en/decklists/find?title=Big+Boxes+Only\">\"big boxes only\"</a> in the deck titles so they can all be retrieved via search.</p>\n\n<hr /><p>The hardest part of building a Butchershop archetype with only the big boxes is finding enough economy to outpace the runner. The modern archetype has access to two great econ operations in <a href=\"/en/card/04076\">Sweeps Week</a> and <a href=\"/en/card/04040\">Restructure</a> which make it possible gain money quickly. The big boxes lack good econ operations, other than <a href=\"/en/card/01110\">Hedge Fund</a>, especially if all your influence is spent on meat damage.</p>\n\n<h4>The ID</h4>\n\n<p>This started out as a <a href=\"/en/card/09003\">Spark</a> deck but I turned to <a href=\"/en/card/09001\">SYNC</a> for a few reasons. While Spark aids you a little bit in your economy war with the runner, it does so at best 2 credits each pair of turns, and even that is tough to achieve with an optimal deck. SYNC turns <a href=\"/en/card/01088\">Data Raven</a> into an incredibly taxing piece of ICE, one which can quickly accrue more fiscal advantage than the Spark ID, while also having a smaller deck size which helps you find your combo pieces.</p>\n\n<h4>Other Card Choices</h4>\n\n<p>The agenda suite looks terrible without <a href=\"/en/card/02115\">Project Beale</a> or the economic swing agendas (<a href=\"/en/card/08094\">Explode-a-palooza</a> &amp; <a href=\"/en/card/04119\">NAPD Contract</a>), but it's not too bad. <a href=\"/en/card/01082\">Breaking News</a> was always the best to grab a kill with Butchershop and now we can fit in 3. We reduce our density a bit with <a href=\"/en/card/09026\">Global Food Initiative</a> and fill in <a href=\"/en/card/01107\">Private Security Force</a> because nothing else fits.</p>\n\n<p>We have a couple avenues to the meat damage kill:</p>\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"/en/card/01082\">Breaking News</a> score</li>\n<li>Recurring <a href=\"/en/card/01082\">Breaking News</a> with <a href=\"/en/card/09019\">24/7 News Cycle</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/en/card/01086\">SEA Source</a></li>\n</ul><p><a href=\"/en/card/02116\">Midseason Replacements</a> isn't actually missed that bad, certainly not as much as the agendas and econ operations.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/en/card/09027\">Launch Campaign</a> accrues money a bit quicker than other drip and is neutral, so it's an auto-include. <a href=\"/en/card/01109\">PAD Campaign</a> takes a few turns to pay off but is hard to trash. Hopefully we can hit a <a href=\"/en/card/01108\">Melange Mining Corp.</a> for a turn or two at some point and our never-advance bluffs are strengthened by the threat of <a href=\"/en/card/09009\">News Team</a>, which is just brutal out of SYNC. <a href=\"/en/card/09016\">Special Offer</a> rounds out the last of our economy choices as a sort of <a href=\"/en/card/02056\">Pop-up Window</a> replacement.</p>\n\n<p>As I noted in my Personal Evolution deck that's only core + big boxes, I'm not sure how to deal with agenda flood in a Jackson-less world and a fourth of this deck is agendas, plus it doesn't have space for <a href=\"/en/card/01058\">Archived Memories</a> which appears to be the best option in the big boxes. I guess you'll just have to protect Archives? Or kill the runner very quickly.</p>\n",

I used only one core set and each of the deluxe expansions to make at least one decklist for every ID available in the Core Set and each deluxe. Obviously a handful of the IDs do not have the support to shine in this limited cardpool, but I tried my best. These decklists exist in a bubble, so \u201cMeta\u201d picks are hard to judge (Sharon Claire and/or Cyberdex Virus Suite vs. Noise, Damage protection for runners), so that\u2019s pretty much for you to decide. For anyone questioning how much fun you can get out of 1 Core and 4 Deluxes, I hope they can have as much fun with these lists as I did making them.</p>\n",

The second was a surprise SEA Source Scorched earth if they ever dropped below four cards, helped along by giving them brain damage through tyr's hand.</p>\n\n<p>As it turns out i was overly reliant on a steady and plenty full economy to rez some of the more fun ice and without a strong economy i wasn't able to protect myself against a well set up runner that could cheaply trash my assets.\nMy second game with this deck was timed out after ten minutes of play as our first game ran long. I ended with six agendas to their four and counted as a draw, I was really enjoying the fast pace and tension the game, almost wanting the runner to find an agenda.</p>\n\n<p>The last game with this deck was ridiculous and i was plain lucky. I had scored (i think, I will take notes next time) four agenda's early on and had a three pointer in hand. The runner had three points when my one piece of ice protecting R&amp;D was trashed. This allowed the runner to hit it with their Medium hard and often. Not having any ice in hand decided to put down the three pointer and due to the tension i can't remember clearly what happened but it ended with a medium with eight tokens on it that found nothing and i was able to score out my last agenda. A great game</p>\n\n<p>In the end I came second overall and really enjoyed the experience.</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>This is my Ken Tenma deck built with a single Core Set and single copy of Honor and Profit. I just threw in most of interesting events I could have, along a few cards that support them nicely. I have been playing this online for a few weeks and it does surprisingly well. It took me a while to learn how to play this, but I think it is a fairly interesting approach - and I did not see anything remotely similar on Jinteki.</p>\n\n<p>The core of your economy engine are 2 Public Terminals and Security Testing + Desperado. This makes you play all runs for free, and secure 3 free creds every turn in most matchups. Additional money comes from Gambles and Armitages, but I tend to hoard them in my hand or just leave on the table until I REALLY need cash - which is not very often. Oracle May works as your draw/economy engine if it is timed after you get your rig in shape. You just use it always as an event draw. Although you got Special Orders and can get this second copy of a breaker, trashing your Desperado and Terminals hurts you irrecoverably. Motivation would probably improve Oracle a lot - but I don't own it yet ;)</p>\n\n<p>Breakers are pretty standard considering I got one Core and H&amp;P. I rarely find use for Killers on remotes, and when I do, I have Inside Job to bypass stuff there. I tried to run Femme for the token, but she is usually too expensive to put out and doesn't do much. On the other hand, Alias is usually crazy cheap and effective - it makes your Legworks and Maker's Eyes a breeze.</p>\n\n<p>Also - slap that Sneakdoor in the endgame and just pound their HQ for as long as you can. In worst scenario, this will thin their ICE as they desperately try to cover Archives, in best it just wins games.</p>\n\n<p>All comments obviously are appreciated, since this is my first deck built all by myself.</p>\n",

Let's get to it step-by-step:</p>\n\n<p>[1] Breaker of ICEs. I have a total of (3) Killers, (2) Fracters and (2) Decoders and (2) AIs. I have a mix of everything.</p>\n\n<p>[2] Economic Engine. Generally 9-12 cards in total. In fact, I have 10 in total.</p>\n\n<p>[4] Use Influence. This ID comes with up to 15 to spend. Use influence to import tricks to confuse and surprise the Corp or to shore up weaknesses in the deck. Here's my thought process for this faction teaching deck.<br />\n- added <a href=\"/en/card/01026\">Femme Fatale</a> for its bypass ability.<br />\n- added <a href=\"/en/card/02043\">Emergency Shutdown</a> and <a href=\"/en/card/01020\">Forged Activation Orders</a> to complement ID's str.<br />\n- added <a href=\"/en/card/01036\">The Maker's Eye</a> and <a href=\"/en/card/02085\">HQ Interface</a> just to throw off the Corp's tempo.<br />\n- added <a href=\"/en/card/02105\">Mr. Li</a> to improve draw ability as I have no other Tutor abilities.</p>\n\n<p>[5] Cutting Cards. We have far more than needed to reach the minimum.<br />\n- removed <a href=\"/en/card/01051\">Crypsis</a> in favour of <a href=\"/en/card/02102\">Darwin</a>.<br />\n- removed <a href=\"/en/card/01053\">Armitage Codebusting</a> since <a href=\"/en/card/02022\">Liberated Account</a> is slightly more efficient and uses click too.<br />\n- removed <a href=\"/en/card/01049\">Infiltration</a> since there is too many econ cards.<br />\n- removed <a href=\"/en/card/02062\">Force of Nature</a>, <a href=\"/en/card/01011\">Mimic</a> and <a href=\"/en/card/02004\">Morning Star</a> one of each to reduce card count while having <a href=\"/en/card/02102\">Darwin</a> as backup.  </p>\n\n<p>Every card should be readily understood, and there should be a minimum of rules clarifications necessary.

    "name": "[Official FFG] [Core + H&P] Reversal of Fortune",
    "description": "<p>This is an official FFG sample deck, as shared in this article http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=4696 </p>\n\n<p>It may not be the <em>most</em> competitive deck out there, but it is a viable deck created from only a single core set and Honor &amp; Profit, and vastly better than the nonsense deck provided in the Honor &amp; Profit insert. So it's an excellent option for new players who only own these expansions so far.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Historically, in Android: Netrunner, Criminals have relied heavily upon their events, including a good number of run events, like the ever-popular <a href=\"/en/card/01018\">Account Siphon</a> and <a href=\"/en/card/01021\">Inside Job</a>. With a number of such events at their disposal, Criminals are never without surprises, and they can push hard and fast against Corporate servers. Accordingly, most Criminals maintain high-tempo, high-pressure strategies designed to attack a Corporation\u2019s economy even as they plunder the Corp\u2019s agenda points.</p>\n\n<p>Such strategies, however, are also relatively high-risk. As a risk-adverse Runner, Iain Stirling presents another approach. Created from one copy of the Core Set and Honor and Profit, this sample deck explores how Iain Stirling might call upon his network of contacts in order to stall the Corp, fund his runs, and dive deep toward the root of a corporation\u2019s central servers.</p>\n\n<p>As with the Corp deck that we posted in our earlier preview (http://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/11896/-official-ffg-core-h-p-bait-blast), nearly half of this deck comes from Honor and Profit, and it marks a radical departure from most existing strategies, especially those Criminal strategies that live and breathe events.</p>\n\n<p>Much of this departure is due to the inclusion of <a href=\"/en/card/05055\">Donut Taganes</a> who increases the play cost of all events and operations by one. Even though Donut Taganes heavily punishes those Corporate economies that rely heavily upon their operations, few Criminals would ever call upon his services because he also increases the cost of the events that comprise a majority of most Criminal decks. Still, Donut will likely have a role to play in many Shaper and Anarch decks, and he plays a role in this deck, as well, because it doesn\u2019t rely so heavily upon events.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, in this deck, Iain Stirling focuses primarily upon calling together his resources, including the pool of contacts that will help him generate quick cash flow and increase his hand size. Then, as he uses his network to build his economy, Iain Stirling looks to stall the Corp through the use of Account Siphon, <a href=\"/en/card/01020\">Forged Activation Orders</a>, and Donut Taganes.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, Iain Stirling is happy to let the Corp get ahead early in the race for agenda points. In fact, he\u2019ll even help it get ahead early through the timely use of <a href=\"/en/card/01031\">Data Dealer</a> because all the time that he\u2019s behind, he gains two free credits at the beginning of his turn.</p>\n\n<p>Traditionally, Android: Netrunner players recognize three different stages of a game. In the early game, the Runner has the advantage since he can run and feint and force the Corp to strain its economy rezzing ice or risk letting the Runner access valuable agenda points. In the midgame, the Corp has protected its servers with ice and bought itself some time to install and advance agendas while the Runner seeks to build a rig capable of breaking through the Corp\u2019s defenses. Finally, in the late game, the Runner has fully developed his rig and his economy and can run once or more every turn, drilling through Corporate servers almost at will.</p>\n\n<p>This is where Iain Stirling and this deck diverge from most Criminals and their strategies: While most Criminals seek to extend their early game advantage as long as possible, Iain Stirling seeks to race through the early game and midgame as quickly as possible in order to enjoy the benefits of an early and extended end game.</p>\n\n<p>With <a href=\"/en/card/05037\">Logos</a>, Iain Stirling can apply the credits he gains from his ability directly toward the cards he wants the most. In turn, he can assemble a rig dedicated toward a strong end game. Using cards like <a href=\"/en/card/01010\">Medium</a> and Legwork, Iain Stirling can quickly transform an early deficit into late game runs that quickly access numerous cards and secure final victory.</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>Start with Basic Deck Building process by combining all Criminal (32 cards) with all Neutral (15 cards). This is a good start but now I have 47 cards while the minimum for this ID is 45 cards. It's better to go minimum to increase draw consistency. Let's get to it step-by-step:</p>\n\n<p>[1] Breaker of ICEs. I have a total of (5) Killers, (3) Fracters and (3) Decoders and (2) AIs. I have a mix of everything.</p>\n\n<p>[2] Economic Engine. Generally 9-12 cards in total. In fact, I have 14 in total.</p>\n\n<p>[4] Use Influence. This ID comes with up to 15 to spend. Use influence to import tricks to confuse and surprise the Corp or to shore up weaknesses in the deck. Here's my thought process for this starter deck.<br />\n- added <a href=\"/en/card/01043\">Gordian Blade</a> for a more efficient Code Gate breaker.<br />\n- added <a href=\"/en/card/01042\">Battering Ram</a> for a more efficient Barrier breaker.<br />\n- added <a href=\"/en/card/01036\">The Maker's Eye</a> just to throw off the Corp's tempo.<br />\n- added <a href=\"/en/card/02101\">Retrieval Run</a> since this synergizes well with <a href=\"/en/card/01051\">Crypsis</a> and <a href=\"/en/card/02104\">Faerie</a> a very efficient Sentry breaker.<br />\n- added <a href=\"/en/card/01048\">Sacrificial Construct</a> for a defensive measure.<br />\n- added <a href=\"/en/card/01004\">Stimhack</a> for an emergency econ card which is ideal for possibly the last push to win the game.</p>\n\n<p>[5] Cutting Cards. We have far more than needed to reach the minimum.<br />\n- removed <a href=\"/en/card/02006\">Peacock</a> except for one just to improve Fracter draw.<br />\n- removed <a href=\"/en/card/01025\">Aurora</a> as this card is just a credit sucker.<br />\n- removed <a href=\"/en/card/01030\">Crash Space</a> leaving only one will do.<br />\n- removed <a href=\"/en/card/01051\">Crypsis</a> leaving only one will do since we have at least 2 of each breaker type together with <a href=\"/en/card/01022\">Special Order</a>.<br />\nI'll leave it at 46 cards :)</p>\n\n<p>Every card should be readily understood, and there should be a minimum of rules clarifications necessary. Enjoy!</p>\n",

    "description": "Most effective suite of breakers chosen, taking Corroders from Anarch one just one Gordian Blade from Shapers. Since Code Gates are not that important in Core set (only Enigma and Tollbooth actually ETR), losing Gordian isn't the end of the world. There are 3xSpecial Order to bring it (or other breakers) to the table, when necessary. The assumption is that Sneakdoor Beta will get to the table first as the only program, to exploit archives a little, and then will get thrashed, either by Runner or some ICE. Parasite acts as additional surprise as an attack vector and to further counter Enigma (Code Gate) and small Weyland ICE (Ice Wall, Shadow, etc.).<br><br>This deck runs a lot of money just from neutral/Criminal cards/actions, but in case of endgame, one Magnum Opus added for a table situation of 1 MO + 3 types of breakers summing up to 5 MU (1 from Desperado). In the late game, you will most probably get MO already, or it should be near your next draw.<br><br>Created for a local core-set only Swiss tournament. The meta assumption was that there will be a lot of tagging (mostly from Weyland), thus Crash Space and Decoy were added for protection. Proven to be very stable and effective if played with the right tempo. You don't necessarily have to do the typical Criminal rush, as there are less FA options for corps in Core. Depending on the draw, it can put a heavy pressure on the corp and can effectively deal with ICE later on. I've finished 1st with Young Gabriel, without losing any Runner game.",

The deck at 49 cards requires 20-21 agenda points. It is always best to go max cards at the max points to reduce the likelihood of drawing agendas.\nI have a total of (10) agenda cards at 21 points. I will remove <a href=\"/en/card/02080\">False Lead</a>.</p>\n\n<p>[2] Decent Spread of ICE. Generally about 15-18 cards in total. I have a total of (4) Sentries, (5) Barriers and (5) Code Gates.</p>\n\n<p>[3] Economic Engine. Generally 9-12 cards in total. In fact, I have 11 in total.</p>\n\n<p>[4] Use Influence. This ID comes with up to 15 to spend. Use influence to import tricks to confuse and surprise the Runner or to shore up weaknesses in the deck. Here's my thought process for this faction teaching deck.<br />\n- added <a href=\"/en/card/01090\">Tollbooth</a> for ETR and to snipe the Runner's bank.<br />\n- added <a href=\"/en/card/01063\">Viktor 1.0</a> for ETR and potential brain dmg.<br />\n- added <a href=\"/en/card/02019\">Caduceus</a>, it has ETR and could trigger creds which are harder to come by for Jinteki.<br />\n- added <a href=\"/en/card/01100\">Shipment from Kaguya</a> to take advantage of <a href=\"/en/card/02033\">Trick of Light</a>.<br />\n- added <a href=\"/en/card/02013\">Ash 2X3ZB9CY</a> and <a href=\"/en/card/01091\">Red Herrings</a> to throw the Runner's tempo off.<br />\n- added <a href=\"/en/card/01098\">Beanstalk Royalties</a> simply for more econ options.  </p>\n\n<p>[5] Cutting Cards. We have far more than needed to reach 49 cards in total.<br />\n- removed <a href=\"/en/card/04013\">Himitsu-Bako</a>, <a href=\"/en/card/01111\">Enigma</a>, <a href=\"/en/card/01112\">Hunter</a>, <a href=\"/en/card/01113\">Wall of Static</a> due to excess ICEs.<br />\n- removed <a href=\"/en/card/01108\">Melange Mining Corp.</a> and <a href=\"/en/card/01109\">PAD Campaign</a> in accordance to lower ICE count so I am unable to protect them.</p>\n\n<p>Every card should be readily understood, and there should be a minimum of rules clarifications necessary.

    "description": "<p>This was my corp deck for @FightingWalloon's teaching league at the end of 2017. It did reasonably well at the start but faded in the latter half of the tournament.</p>\n\n<p>Despite the low power level of Green Level Clearance in full play, it shines in Core only games and especially with Weyland, providing as much as Beanstalk Royalties will in any other ID plus a card draw.</p>\n\n<p>Trick of Light was there to take advantage of Shipment from Kaguya helping to power ice quicker without having to slow advance ice. Tollbooth is good on centrals to minimise accesses early on.</p>\n\n<p>Aim to get a double counter Atlas early on to start rushing the game before the runner gets set up. Then use the Atlas counters to grab cards as needed (preferably a 3 pointer or another Atlas if the runner is still struggling). If you can get 5 points on the board with 2 atlas tokens, use hostile takeover to finish the game off.</p>\n\n<p>You could replace Trick with 2 Biotic Labors but you'd need to remove a Tollbooth at least to cover the influence.</p>\n\n<p>I hope this will prove useful for newer players!</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>Can we build an anarch deck that works with only core and O&amp;C?  Lets see!</p>\n\n<h3>Notes</h3>\n\n<ul><li>Econ is hard.  Thus 21/46 of the deck is econ or draw (46 card decks are <em>all the rage</em> now...thanks Calimsha!).  You're actually likely econ <em>heavy</em>.  If so, you can add more tricks (the cutlery come to mind).</li>\n<li>The rest of the deck is devoted to either efficient ice breaking (fixed breakers + <a href=\"/en/card/01008\">Datasucker</a>s + <a href=\"/en/card/01015\">Ice Carver</a>) or ice destruction (<a href=\"/en/card/07035\">Wanton Destruction</a> + <a href=\"/en/card/07037\">Forked</a> + <a href=\"/en/card/01012\">Parasite</a> + <a href=\"/en/card/01002\">D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu</a> for <a href=\"/en/card/01012\">Parasite</a>).</li>\n<li>HQ pressure is <a href=\"/en/card/07028\">Edward Kim: Humanity's Hammer</a>'s ability, <a href=\"/en/card/01018\">Account Siphon</a>, and <a href=\"/en/card/07035\">Wanton Destruction</a>.  That's pretty damn good pressure.</li>\n<li>R&amp;D pressure is <a href=\"/en/card/07028\">Edward Kim: Humanity's Hammer</a>'s ability, and <a href=\"/en/card/01010\">Medium</a>.</li>\n<li>Archives pressure is <a href=\"/en/card/01008\">Datasucker</a>.</li>\n</ul><h3>How to play</h3>\n\n<p>The name of the game is constant pressure.  You better be running <em>all the time</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The idea is to keep the gas on the entire game (this <strong>must</strong> be very aggressive to win), and get some <a href=\"/en/card/01008\">Datasucker</a>s with some tokens early.  Continue drawing aggressively to get the breakers.  Feel free to face-check if you have <a href=\"/en/card/01012\">Parasite</a>s in your deck.  Worst case, you have to use a <a href=\"/en/card/01002\">D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu</a> to get your breaker's back.  If you can get the <a href=\"/en/card/01018\">Account Siphon</a>s rolling in, you're on your way to winning.  If this opening exists (i.e. because you can get into HQ cheaply, or could <a href=\"/en/card/01012\">Parasite</a> away all ice on HQ, then get the Siphon-train going with <a href=\"/en/card/01002\">D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu</a>.</p>\n\n<p>When the corp is satisfied they've built up the super-remote, and tries to score, show that they they're never safe with a <a href=\"/en/card/01004\">Stimhack</a> in.  What's a little brain damage between friends.</p>\n\n<h3>Weaknesses</h3>\n\n<ul><li>Lotus field.  If you need to get in with this guy around, you need your <a href=\"/en/card/01051\">Crypsis</a>, plain and simple.</li>\n<li>High strength ice.  You really need your <a href=\"/en/card/01015\">Ice Carver</a>s up against high-strength ice decks.  Consider using your <a href=\"/en/card/01008\">Datasucker</a> tokens along with <a href=\"/en/card/01012\">Parasite</a>s to provide the lasting solution for beefy ice like Tollbooth.</li>\n<li>Virus purges.  The corp has a simple formula to keep you out:  Get an ice of strength 4 or higher on each central, and purge.  Keep this in mind, and use your <a href=\"/en/card/01012\">Parasite</a>s accordingly.  Digging for <a href=\"/en/card/01015\">Ice Carver</a> or <a href=\"/en/card/01051\">Crypsis</a> if this happens is your way to more sucker tokens.  However, if this happens, it is such a tempo hit, that you basically lost.  Don't let this happen.</li>\n</ul>",

    "name": "Jinteki (PE) - Shell game (Deck from Single Core Set)",
    "description": "<p>Just like everyone else, I started learning to play A:NR with Jinteki Vs. Kate (as the rulebook suggests). I played too many games as corp only with a single runner friend (playing Kate of course) and I always felt so poor. Not many ways to make <span class=\"icon icon-credit\"></span>credits other than <span class=\"icon icon-click\"></span>clicking for it or <a href=\"/en/card/01110\">Hedge Fund</a> if I'm lucky enough, while on the other side there was a juicy <a href=\"en/card/01044\">Magnum Opus</a> for up to 8cr per turn. Frustrated as I was, I started researching for my first deckbuilding. Rules were simple enough regarding Agendas and Influence, but I still couldn't make my core <a href=\"en/card/01067\">Jinteki</a> deck rich enough. How can I protect myself if I can't pay 4<span class=\"icon icon-credit\"></span> for a <a href=\"/en/card/01070\">Snare!</a> or advance a <a href=\"/en/card/01069\">Project Junebug</a>? I figured Jinteki mindgames are not for beginners and went exploring other factions. The glacier approach seems like the safest most reliable route, build an ICE fort and advance. <a href=\"/en/card/01054\">HB</a>] became my favorite, followed by <a href=\"/en/card/01093\">Weyland</a>. <a href=\"/en/card/01080\">NBN</a> feels very awkward, no traps for shell game, no money for big forts...lots of tags and little punishment....</p>\n\n<p>Jinteki is a different beast. It's all about taking risks, lots of bluffs and trying to flatline the runner. It doesn't need much ice, just a few punishing ones for central servers and a lot of unprotected remotes; there could be traps or agendas. </p>\n\n<p>There are plenty of assets in this deck for a shell game to work and there are two types of runners. Those who check everything and those scared to fall prey to a trap and wait for a cue, or play infiltration. If they run everything, don't install open agendas and set a small scoring server with 1-2 ETR ice. They won't have enough credits because they've been occupied trashing all the assets or recovering from trap damages and/or they didn't set up the breaking suit yet. For those scared to run naked remotes, you can bluff agendas and advance them alongside <a href=\"/en/card/01069\">Project Junebug</a> or <a href=\"/en/card/01057\">Aggressive Secretary</a>. Advancing &amp; scoring isn't Jinteki's go-to move though. Whenever I focus on winning by scoring with <a href=\"/en/card/01067\">PE</a>, I lose.</p>\n\n<p>There are a few combos you can use to kill the runner, keep the flatline plan as a priority. </p>\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"/en/card/01075\">Chum</a> over <a href=\"/en/card/01077\">Neural Katana</a> or <a href=\"/en/card/01078\">Wall of Thorns</a>. </li>\n<li><a href=\"/en/card/01077\">Neural Katana</a> over <a href=\"/en/card/01076\">Data Mine</a> protecting a <a href=\"/en/card/01070\">Snare!</a> or an advanced <a href=\"/en/card/01069\">Project Junebug</a>.</li>\n<li>Boost a <a href=\"/en/card/01077\">Neural Katana</a> with <a href=\"/en/card/01065\">Corporate Troubleshooter</a> so the won't be able to break it.</li>\n</ul><p>etc....</p>\n\n<p>Even if they steal an Agenda, that's 1 net damage and you can seal the deal with <a href=\"/en/card/01072\">Neural EMP</a>.\nFor the runners that don't respect tags and keep them upon hitting a <a href=\"/en/card/01070\">snare</a> or by <a href=\"/en/card/01018\">siphoning</a> you, there's a surprise <a href=\"/en/card/01099\">Scorched Earth</a> in the deck that goes really well with EMPs and <a href=\"/en/card/01107\">Private Security Force</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, Jinteki along NBN are the poorest corporations. I splashed a couple of <a href=\"/en/card/01098\">Beanstalk Royalties</a> and an <a href=\"/en/card/01056\">Adonis Campaign</a> to help the situation. Hopefully you can use <a href=\"/en/card/01108\">Melange Mining Corp.</a> 1-2 times before they get to trash it. <a href=\"/en/card/01109\">PAD Campaigns</a> work like a charm. Even if they trash it, they lose 4<span class=\"icon icon-credit\"></span>. <a href=\"/en/card/01058\">Archived Memories</a> can recur a bit of economy, but they're mostly for bringing back traps or trashed Agendas by that <a href=\"/en/card/01001\">Noise</a> vandal. </p>\n\n<p>There are a few in-faction cards I left behind, as they never helped me won a game. <a href=\"/en/card/01074\">Cell Portal</a>...what a useless card. Jinteki can't pay 5<span class=\"icon icon-credit\"></span> to force the runner pass <a href=\"/en/card/01077\">Neural Katana</a> for a 2nd time...and all this hustle for an expensive ice to be derezzed again. <a href=\"/en/card/01073\">Precognition</a> is an awesome card, especially if you get R&amp;D locked but we're not going for scoring and it seems like a waste of clicks. Play the shell game and the combo pieces will slowly come.</p>\n\n<p>Not much ICE in this deck, focus more on the traps than protecting/advancing and if you don't like the flatlining plan, use the following deck or a different faction:</p>\n\n<h3>Agenda (9)</h3>\n\n<ul><li>3x <a href=\"http://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/01068\">Nisei MK II</a> <em>(Core Set)</em></li>\n<li>3x <a href=\"http://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/01106\">Priority Requisition</a> <em>(Core Set)</em> </li>\n<li>3x <a href=\"http://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/01107\">Private Security Force</a> <em>(Core Set)</em> </li>\n</ul><h3>Asset (13)</h3>\n\n<ul><li>3x <a href=\"http://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/01056\">Adonis Campaign</a> <em>(Core Set)</em> \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 \u2022</li>\n<li>2x <a href=\"http://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/01108\">Melange Mining Corp.</a> <em>(Core Set)</em> </li>\n<li>3x <a href=\"http://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/01109\">PAD Campaign</a> <em>(Core Set)</em> </li>\n<li>2x <a href=\"http://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/01069\">Project Junebug</a> <em>(Core Set)</em> </li>\n<li>3x <a href=\"http://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/01070\">Snare!</a> <em>(Core Set)</em> </li>\n</ul><h3>Operation (10)</h3>\n\n<ul><li>3x <a href=\"http://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/01098\">Beanstalk Royalties</a> <em>(Core Set)</em> \u2022\u2022\u2022</li>\n<li>3x <a href=\"http://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/01110\">Hedge Fund</a> <em>(Core Set)</em> </li>\n<li>2x <a href=\"http://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/01072\">Neural EMP</a> <em>(Core Set)</em> </li>\n<li>2x <a href=\"http://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/01073\">Precognition</a> <em>(Core Set)</em> </li>\n</ul><h3>Barrier (7)</h3>\n\n<ul><li>2x <a href=\"http://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/01103\">Ice Wall</a> <em>(Core Set)</em> \u2022\u2022</li>\n<li>3x <a href=\"http://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/01113\">Wall of Static</a> <em>(Core Set)</em> </li>\n<li>2x <a href=\"http://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/01078\">Wall of Thorns</a> <em>(Core Set)</em> </li>\n</ul><h3>Code Gate (7)</h3>\n\n<ul><li>2x <a href=\"http://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/01075\">Chum</a> <em>(Core Set)</em> </li>\n<li>3x <a href=\"http://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/01111\">Enigma</a> <em>(Core Set)</em> </li>\n<li>2x <a href=\"http://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/01090\">Tollbooth</a> <em>(Core Set)</em> \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022</li>\n</ul><h3>Sentry (3)</h3>\n\n<ul><li>3x <a href=\"http://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/01077\">Neural Katana</a> <em>(Core Set)</em> </li>\n</ul><p>15 influence spent (max 15)<br />\n21 agenda points (between 20 and 21)<br />\n49 cards (min 45)<br />\nCards up to Core Set</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>People often ask for starter decks when they first get Netrunner to get an idea of how to deck build or what makes a deck strong. The recommended starter decks in the core set aren\u2019t very efficient nor do they use any influence, so I have worked with some friends to design a few starter decks. Every starter deck is made of a single core set and we have also made variants with no 1-of cards so anyone with 3 core-sets can throw together these starter decks and have them lying around to introduce new players. We have tested the Beginner decks against each other and the Intermediate decks against each other and they are pretty balance with the runner winning slightly more often.</p>\n\n<p>Beginner decks are designed for players just picking up the game. They are straight forward and have very little tricks.</p>\n\n<p>Intermediate decks introduce players to more complex and interesting concepts such as search, traps, and viruses.</p>\n\n<p>Advanced decks are your own decks that you design and build. Get familiar with the other factions and cards. Experiment and have fun!</p>\n\n<p>This deck is the most basic of runner decks. Get money, play your breakers, and run. Since this is a beginner deck we didn\u2019t want to use search as new players would have no idea what ice breakers they should even search for. Instead we put in enough breakers that you are bound to hit them pretty quickly. Diesels are good for digging if needed. </p>\n\n<p>To make this deck with no 1-ofs.\n-1 The Toolbox\n+1 Tinkering</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>This is the first deck I have published with a fairly limited set of cards (Core 2.0, Honor and Profit, Creation and Control, Order and Chaos). I've played four games with it so far, with three ending in victory, and have already published an earlier version. But, I am aware this is far from enough playtesting and so I am publishing with a view to gaining some feedback.</p>\n\n<p>As the name implies, this deck is all about trying to build a big, powerful rig, and having enough creds to utilise those icebreakers effectively. Chaos Theory can, with her 5 MU, install copies of all the breakers and if Logos is also installed, a second copy of Cloak can be added. I felt Logos was a better shout than Dinosaurus as I think these breakers have reasonable strength, are fairly efficient to run, the possibility of free draw is appealing, and I don't feel the need to have a program installed on Dinosaurus (I had previously also included Magnum Opus in this deck, but felt it was unnecessary with some of the econ cards I'm running).</p>\n\n<p>Beyond the rig setup I was just choosing cards which are appealing or interesting to me. I like having a good economy, but don't feel I have optimised it here, and perhaps have too much. Day Job is useful for a burst of creds when things aren't quite working ou. I felt Freelance Coding Contract was worth an include to get some extra creds if I draw more programs once they are all installed but after a few plays I haven't used it once so it's liable to get cut. I've included a few copies of SMC to replace Special Order and thrown Levy AR Lab Access in there to try and recycle cards. I've also been looking at some cards I don't yet have and Paperclip sounds like a potential replacement for Battering Ram, while Smoke may be a better ID for this deck.</p>\n\n<p>Any thoughts would be appreciated. When providing feedback, please bear in mind the limited card pool I currently have (listed above). Thanks!</p>\n",

This goes alongside my blogposts on the same subject: <a href=\"http://blog.nicelygroomedbeard.com/post/133873251128/learning-netrunner-1011\">Learning Netrunner 101</a></p>\n\n<p>This is <strong>first and foremost a teaching deck</strong>, this means that it may not be the most optimal Core Set deck you can build, but it will contain a lot of important concepts for teaching a new player the basics. Ideally this deck is piloted by the teacher first.</p>\n\n<h1>Agendas</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"/en/card/01068\">Nisei MK II</a>: (4/2) This gives the Corp one \u201cstop the run\u201d at any time they want, a very, very, powerful ability. Great for stopping the Runner\u2019s \u201cglory run\u201d.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/en/card/01106\">Priority Requisition</a>: (5/3) This plays a dual-role in your teaching deck. It\u2019s first job is just to be a really cool ability. You will score Priority Requisition, and then you will rez a really honkin\u2019 big piece of ICE for free! (If you\u2019re playing against a new player, make sure not to rez a Tollbooth over your scoring server, as that\u2019s going to be extremely difficult to break for even a good player).</p>\n\n<p>Its second job is to be a juicy 3 point Agenda that the Runner will steal. Yes - in this teaching deck you\u2019re going to be pulling your punches and maybe allowing them to steal something when they shouldn\u2019t.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/en/card/01107\">Private Security Force</a>: (4/2) This Agenda is mostly because there are no great options for Jinteki out of Core Set. This Agenda will allow you to show off an active Agenda ability. Once this is scored you will be able to do 1 meat damage to a player if and when they are tagged. Unfortunately for this deck you only have a single source of tagging, Snare!</p>\n\n<hr /><h1>Assets</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"/en/card/01108\">Melange Mining Corp.</a>: Cheap to trash, but can be really powerful if not trashed. Install this naked and use it once, see if you can get away with using it twice. Good for training the Runner to go trash stuff.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/en/card/01109\">PAD Campaign</a>: Expensive to trash, but potentially very powerful for the Corp if they go unchecked. While it costs FOUR credits to trash, try to explain that this is a single Sure Gamble's worth of credits, and it will eventually pay out way more than the 4 credits it will cost to trash. A good cost/benefit analysis kind of card.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/en/card/01069\">Project Junebug</a>: Use it to bluff an Agenda, then when they run on the server, remind them that if this <em>is</em> a trap, they will be taking some hefty Net Damage. Good to remind the Runner that not everything is worth touching.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/en/card/01070\">Snare!</a>: Woo! Teach the Runner that sometimes even random accesses can result in pain. Also remind them that it will do 3 Net Damage before they go run on an undefended remote (which could be a Snare!). Also point out that it does not fire from Archives and DOES fire from R&amp;D/HQ/Servers.</p>\n\n<hr /><h1>Operations</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"/en/card/01083\">Anonymous Tip</a>: Card draw is always nice with 3 clicks.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/en/card/01098\">Beanstalk Royalties</a>: Allows you to get some money back if you go broke popping a Snare!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/en/card/01110\">Hedge Fund</a>: Hedge Fund.</p>\n\n<hr /><h1>ICE</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"/en/card/01103\">Ice Wall</a>: Shows the Runner you can advance ICE. This will probably blow their mind at first. You want to give them something not-scary to facecheck if you've put 3 counters on it however, and Ice Wall is perfect for that.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/en/card/01113\">Wall of Static</a>: MVP of Core Set. Put it down and start scoring behind it ASAP. The Runner WILL get through eventually.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/en/card/01078\">Wall of Thorns</a>: Probably the most \"wacky\" card to include in the deck. WoT is here for Archives protection, go ahead and throw 2 or 3 points into the Archives, but then have the cash on hand to stop their run once they start getting fishy. A wall that hurts?! Explain to them how rare this really is.</p>\n\n<hr /><p><a href=\"/en/card/01111\">Enigma</a>: A great example of a Code Gate. It does something weird (lose a click), and ends the run, without being too punishing. When you rez this make sure to point out that if they hit this on their last click, then \"losing a click\" means nothing to them, and so they don't have to break this subroutine. (Then remind them that running on the last click is scary!)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/en/card/01090\">Tollbooth</a>: Big daddy. Tollbooth, even now, is a really hard to get around piece of ICE. Throw this on a server you want the Runner to never get into. Almost nobody is ready to do the math on Tollbooth for their first game. Great Priority Requisition target, as you can explain the \"on Encounter\" ability before they get to the card.</p>\n\n<hr /><p><a href=\"/en/card/01077\">Neural Katana</a>: Your meanest Sentry. Don't warn them about this card, just rez it, and fire away. Once it hits them make sure you discuss the many ways around it - including any Killer they might have in their deck.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/en/card/01064\">Rototurret</a>: A possibly meaner Sentry?? While this one will not hurt their life, this will do a double duty of trashing a program (great for teaching new players about how terrible this feels) AND ending the run. The very low strength will mean it's easy to break later on.</p>\n\n<hr /><p><a href=\"/en/card/01076\">Data Mine</a>: Who doesn't like a Trap? They are very rare and you can use this opportunity to discuss how non-AI Icebreakers have no way of stopping this subroutine from firing.</p>\n\n<hr /><h1>Teachable Moments</h1>\n\n<p><strong>Install a card, then advance it twice in one turn.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Use this move (referred to as IAA, or Install-Advance-Advance) to tell the Runner of the possible plays you could be making. This card could be a 4/2 Agenda I\u2019ll score next turn, with a click left over, or it could be a 5/3 that I will have to spend my entire next turn to score. OR it could be that Project Junebug, which will do Net Damage equal to double the number of advancement counters on the card. If they have more than 3 cards in hand they should be \u201csafe\u201d to run on this. It\u2019s up to them if they want to take the risk.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Drop below 3 credits, then drop a naked Snare!</strong></p>\n\n<p>If the Runner runs on Snare! they will be disheartened, but then you can remind them that Snare! isn\u2019t free for the Corp - they have to fork over 4 credits for the ability. Without those credits the Runner can pay the 0 to trash Snare! and never worry about it again. This teaches the Runner to pay attention to the Corp\u2019s credit pool. If they have 4+ credits: you could get stung!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use Priority Requisition to rez a Tollbooth.</strong></p>\n\n<p>This allows the runner to see Tollbooth before they blindly run into this piece of ICE. Because Tollbooth has an \u201con encounter\u201d ability - use this time to explain to the Runner that this ability will always fire, and so any costs associated with breaking the subroutine will be on TOP of this 3 credit toll.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bonus Mean Teacher Move: Install a Data Mine protecting a Snare! or an advanced Project Junebug.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Say they make a Run with 4 cards in hand, on a server with a twice advanced card (Project Junebug), protected by one piece of ICE. The ICE ends up being Data Mine, so they take 1 Net Damage, bringing their Grip down to 3 cards. At this point you can remind the Runner that before they continue onto the next layer of ICE (or to the server), they are allowed to Jack Out, ending the run. Also remind them that if this is not game point for the Corp, then letting them score an Agenda when you\u2019re not ready to stop them is sometimes the price of Netrunning.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Punish any tag from Snare! by using Private Security Force</strong></p>\n\n<p>Good luck, but if you ever manage to get into this golden scenario, spend 2 of your clicks doing meat damage, and your last click drawing a card. At this point you can discuss the pure hell that would be \u201cPSF Lock\u201d, which would have the Corp spending their three clicks doing three meat damage until the tag is removed. Unfortunately for this deck the Snare! is the only place to get a tag, so this might never come up.</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>This was my runner deck for the 2018 Stimhack Revised Core 2.0 tournament, claiming top spot. The basic premise is to get set up quickly, with Magnum Opus, and draw quickly or use Test Run to find the remaining breakers, using Modded for discounts to ensure that you have money for those crucial R&amp;D runs. Rabbit Hole and Underworld Contact provide some additional economy drip if you can find them fast enough. That said, against the Jinteki matchup, try to keep them as you have very few cards to guard against the damage that's being done.</p>\n\n<p>Deck improvements:</p>\n\n<p>Liberated Account was largely useless in all the games since an early Magnum will save you from installing them for the rest of the game, plus it's an extra tempo loss when Magnum is slow enough as is. Pipeline is also very weak, costing a whopping 14 credits to fully break an Archer, the strongest sentry in the core set. The best solution I've seen is Mimic and The Personal Touch on a Dinosaurus. So swap out 2 Pipeline for 2 Mimic and 2 Liberated Accounts for 2 Personal Touches.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks go to FightingWalloon for organising the tournament and also everyone who helped me test the deck through it's various forms!</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>Very often, when creating a deck, you build it around its ID and agendas.  Unfortunately, the Core set has incredibly lackluster agendas, especially for poor old Jinteki.  <a href=\"/en/card/01068\">Nisei MK II</a> is a fine agenda, and its very powerful \"end the run agenda counter\" can be used in all sorts of mischievous ways.  Runners tend to forget this token in their calculations.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the only other two legal agendas in Core are <a href=\"/en/card/01107\">Private Security Force</a> and <a href=\"/en/card/01106\">Priority Requisition</a>.  PriReq is great for rezzing <a href=\"/en/card/01101\">Archer</a>, good for rezzing <a href=\"/en/card/01078\">Wall of Thorns</a>, but that's about it.  PSF is a almost a dead card in this deck, for better or worse, but if the runner stupidly keeps themselves tagged after hitting a <a href=\"/en/card/01070\">Snare!</a>, then you might be able to use it.</p>\n\n<p>What you want to do with this deck is create as many remote servers as possible, some of them iced, some of them naked, then slowly advance some of the unrezzed cards in those servers, either manually or via <a href=\"/en/card/01100\">Shipment from Kaguya</a>.    Don't be afraid to advance naked agendas.  The Runner will often be worried they are traps and not run them.</p>\n\n<p>On the topic of traps, realize that <a href=\"/en/card/01070\">Snare!</a> protects your HQ and R&amp;D, but is mostly useless in remotes.  Keep it in hand when you draw into it, if possible.   But, you MUST have 4 credits in hand to spring the Snare.  If it's accessed when you have less than 4, the runner will simply trash it for free it into Archives.  Never let this happen: always have more than 4 credits at the end of your turn.  Always.  The other two traps, <a href=\"/en/card/01057\">Aggressive Secretary</a> and <a href=\"/en/card/01069\">Project Junebug</a> need to be installed and advanced in order to fire.  They also require money to spring, but not as much.  Get those out of R&amp;D and HQ and down onto the board as soon as possible.</p>\n\n<p>Standard openings are icing up the centrals one or two deep: R&amp;D against Shaper and Anarchs, HQ against Criminal.  Do not rez ice until it really matters (for instance, don't rez <a href=\"/en/card/01064\">Rototurret</a> unless you can trash one of their key programs).  Rezzing ice too soon can keep you poor, and Core Jinteki is almost always too poor.  <a href=\"/en/card/01108\">Melange Mining Corp.</a> helps with that (but if not protected, will quickly be trashed), as do <a href=\"/en/card/01098\">Beanstalk Royalties</a>, <a href=\"/en/card/01110\">Hedge Fund</a>, and to a lesser extent, <a href=\"/en/card/01106\">Priority Requisition</a> and <a href=\"/en/card/01100\">Shipment from Kaguya</a>.</p>\n\n<p>A typical mid-game turn might look like: click 1: install agenda or trap; click 2 and 3: advance advance.  This can put some psychological pressure on the runner.  Allowing you to score a <a href=\"/en/card/01106\">Priority Requisition</a> can often ensure you the win, so now you've put them into a tough position. Another way to put pressure on the runner is: click 1: install <a href=\"/en/card/01068\">Nisei MK II</a>, click 2: install <a href=\"/en/card/01057\">Aggressive Secretary</a>, click 3: play <a href=\"/en/card/01100\">Shipment from Kaguya</a> and advance the Nisei and Secretary.  Now if the runner runs the Secretary first, you kill whatever program they need to get into the Nisei or R&amp;D.</p>\n\n<p>What you don't ever want to happen is for the runner to obtain an \"R&amp;D lock\" on you: where they can always access cards in R&amp;D each turn, denying you the ability to draw into agenads and potentially score them.  Therefore, protecting R&amp;D is almost always a good idea, no matter which runner faction you're facing.</p>\n\n<p>If you have 3 <a href=\"/en/card/01072\">Neural EMP</a>s in your hand before click 1, 6 credits, and the runner has fewer than three cards, congrats!  You've just won: you can flatline the runner on your turn. This doesn't happen often, but when it does, it's amazing.  Your ID, <a href=\"/en/card/01067\">Jinteki: Personal Evolution</a>, will help you keep cards from their hands, along with <a href=\"/en/card/01076\">Data Mine</a>, <a href=\"/en/card/01078\">Wall of Thorns</a>, <a href=\"/en/card/01077\">Neural Katana</a>, and <a href=\"/en/card/01063\">Viktor 1.0</a>.</p>\n",
